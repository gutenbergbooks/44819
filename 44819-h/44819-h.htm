<p class="center">"ALAS! WHY DID SHE DO IT?"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What is the matter? Oh, nothing&mdash;a girl<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is found here in suicide rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Romantic? Of course; here's a rich, dark curl<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On the beautiful, blue-veined breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i26"><span class="smcap">Amelia V. Purdy</span>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Incredible, you say?</p>

<p>Alas, it was too true!</p>

<p>She was dead by her own hand, the beautiful child-wife
of Vincent Carew, the millionaire&mdash;dead in her
youth and beauty, leaving behind her all that life held for
a worshipped wife and loving mother; for upstairs at this
moment in the silken nursery her child, the baby Kathleen,
barely six months old, lay sweetly sleeping, watched
by an attentive French <i>bonne</i>, while in the darkened parlor
below, the girlish mother, not yet eighteen, lay pale
and beautiful in her coffin, with white flowers blooming
on the pulseless breast, hiding the crimson stain where
the slight jeweled dagger from her hair had sheathed
itself in her tortured heart.</p>

<p>She was so young, so ignorant, or surely she would
have held back her suicidal hand&mdash;she would have taken
pity on her child, the dark-eyed little heiress she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
leaving motherless in the wide, wide world that, whatever
else it may give us, can not make up for the loss of
the best thing life has to offer&mdash;a mother's love!</p>

<p>It is always a terrible misfortune to a young girl to be
motherless, and it was going to be the tragedy of Kathleen
Carew's life that she had no mother. The dagger-thrust
that let out the life-blood of unhappy Zaidee
Carew turned the whole course of her daughter's life
aside into different channels.</p>

<p>But that lay in the future. <i>Now</i> all Boston wondered
over the tragic death of Vincent Carew's wife, and
people asked each other in dismay:</p>

<p>"Why did she do it?"</p>

<p>No one could answer that question.</p>

<p>The world thought that the young wife was perfectly
happy.</p>

<p>And why not? Surely she had good cause.</p>

<p>Vincent Carew, the rich bachelor, who was a power
in politics, and aspired to be governor of his state, had
married Zaidee Franklyn out of a poverty-stricken home,
lifting her at a bound to rank and fortune, and all for
love of her fair face.</p>

<p>He had snapped his white fingers in the face of the
world that called his marriage a <i>mésalliance</i>, and carried
everything by storm. For his sake, society&mdash;cultured
Boston society&mdash;had received his wife, the lovely young
Southern girl, with her shy ways and neglected education,
and for a time all went well.</p>

<p>So no one could answer the question why did she kill
herself, but that was because Vincent Carew was too
proud to admit the ubiquitous reporter inside his aristocratic
portals. If one of these curious mortals had secured
admittance to the house and questioned the servants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
they would have told him what they suspected and
discussed in whispers among themselves&mdash;that madame
was madly jealous of the teacher her husband had employed
to finish her very imperfect education.</p>

<p>"She is a snake in the grass, that pretty widow, and
she makes my mistress unhappy," said the housekeeper,
the first month that Mrs. Belmont came, and her opinion
was adopted by all the other servants. They all hated
the stately young widow in her black garments, and when
the grewsome tragedy of Mrs. Carew's death darkened
the sunlight in that luxurious home, they whispered to
each other that it was Mrs. Belmont who had worked
their mistress such bitter woe that she could not bear
her life.</p>

<p>If indeed she had schemed for anything like this, Mrs.
Belmont had succeeded in her designs. Zaidee Carew,
with her own dimpled, white hand, had cut the Gordian
knot of life, and in a few more days a stately funeral
<i>cortège</i> moved away from Vincent Carew's doors to the
cemetery where his dead wife, in all her youthful beauty,
was laid to rest beneath the grass and flowers.</p>

<span class="i26"><span class="smcap">Amelia V. Purdy</span>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I never saw such a forgetful girl as you, Kathleen
Carew. Here you sit dreaming, instead of dressing for
'Prince Karl' to-night. Are you going to the theater,
then, or not?"</p>

<p>"Of course I am going, Alpine. I did not know it
was so late. What, you are dressed already? How sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
you look! That blue crêpe de Chine is awfully becoming
to you. Well, then, please ring the bell for my maid,
won't you? I'll be ready in ten minutes."</p>

<p>"You'd better. Mamma will be furious if you keep
her waiting," Alpine Belmont answered, crossly, as she
touched the bell.</p>

<p>Then she looked back curiously at the graceful, indolent
figure in the easy-chair, leaning back with white
hands clasped on top of the bronze-gold head.</p>

<p>"Kathleen, what were you thinking about so intently
when I came in? I had to speak twice before you heard
me."</p>

<p>Kathleen raised her dark, passionate, Oriental eyes to
the speaker's face, and, blushing vivid crimson, answered,
dreamily:</p>

<p>"Alpine, I was thinking of that handsome young man
who saved my life at Newport last summer. I was wondering
who he was, and if we should ever see him again."</p>

<p>"It isn't likely we ever will," answered Alpine Belmont,
carelessly. "I don't suppose he's in our set at all&mdash;some
poor clerk spending all his winter's savings on a
short summer outing, very likely. I wouldn't be thinking
about him, like a romantic school-girl, if I were you,
Kathleen. He didn't care about you, or he would have
made himself known to you before this," and, with a low,
taunting laugh, Alpine Belmont left the room just as
Susette, the maid, came in.</p>

<p>"You'll have to do my hair in a hurry, Susie. There's
no time for prinking," laughed her mistress; and while
the maid brushed out the magnificent, rippling tresses,
Kathleen relapsed into thoughts of the unknown hero
whose handsome image haunted her thoughts.</p>

<p>"Is it true, as Alpine says, that he did not care for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
me? It is strange he did not stay to inquire who I was,
after I came so near drowning. If he was a poor young
clerk, as Alpine believes, perhaps he was too proud to reveal
himself, thinking I would scorn him because I was
an heiress. Ah, how little he knew Kathleen Carew's
heart!"</p>

<p>Her thoughts ran thrillingly on:</p>

<p>"Oh, how handsome he was when I first saw him in the
water, that day at Newport! He kept watching me, and
I could not help looking back. He seemed to draw my
eyes. I know I wanted him to like me, for I wondered
if my bathing suit was becoming, and I felt glad my hair
was down, because I had been told it looked pretty that
way, all wet and curling over my shoulders. His brown
eyes said as plain as words that he admired me. Other
men did, too, I know, but this time it seemed to thrill me
with a new pleasure. As I splashed about like a mermaid
in the waves, I kept thinking of him, wondering who he
was, and hoping he would be at the ball that night. I
wanted him to see how well I looked in my white lace
and pearls. Then all at once came that treacherous undertow
that swept me from my feet, down, down, down,
under the heavy waves. Oh, how horrible it was! I
thought I would be drowned, and my last thought
was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What gown, Miss Kathleen?" asked the maid.</p>

<p>"Anything, Susette. It don't matter how I look to-night.
You can't decide? Oh, well, that new white cloth
with the pink ostrich feather trimming, and diamonds.
Alpine is wearing pearls and a blue gown, and we don't
want to be dressed alike."</p>

<p>While Susette fastened the exquisite gown and clasped
the diamonds, her thoughts ran on:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"He rescued me, the handsome, brave fellow, and as
soon as he laid me, limp, but faintly conscious, upon the
sands, he walked hastily away, and no one at Newport
ever saw him again. Neither could any one ever find out
who he was, although I'm afraid mamma did not try very
hard. But he was certainly very modest. He did not
want us to make a hero of him. Heigho, I do wish I
knew his name&mdash;I do wish I could see him again! Alpine
says I am foolish and romantic, and that I fell in love
with him because he saved my life. Indeed, I think it was
before&mdash;yes, at the very moment I first met his beautiful
brown eyes gazing so eagerly into mine. A quick electric
thrill seemed to dart through me, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Kathleen, aren't you ready yet?" asked Alpine, entering.
"The carriage has been waiting ever so long, and
mamma is getting furious over your delay."</p>

<p>"I'm ready," Kathleen answered, composedly, without
hurrying the least bit. She drew her white opera-cloak
leisurely about her ivory-white shoulders, and followed
her step-sister down-stairs to where Vincent Carew's second
wife, once the widow Belmont, poor Zaidee's governess,
was waiting in impotent wrath at the detention.</p>

<p>"The first act will be quite over before we get there,
and it will be entirely your fault, for Alpine and I have
been ready for an hour," she fretted as they entered the
carriage.</p>

<p class="center">"THIS PRINCE KARL&mdash;THIS RALPH CHAINEY&mdash;IS MY RESCUER
AT NEWPORT LAST SUMMER," WHISPERED THE ROMANTIC
GIRL.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This is the way of it, wide world over,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One is beloved, and one is the lover,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One gives and the other receives.<br /></span>
<span class="i26">E. W. W.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>The first act had indeed begun when Mrs. Carew with
her two daughters entered their box at the theater; but
absorbing as was the interest in the popular play, "Prince
Karl," many heads were turned to gaze admiringly at the
trio of fair ones, for the matron, although fifty years old,
looked much younger, and her stately charms were set off
to advantage by black velvet and jet, with ruby ornaments
on her neck and arms. Her silvery-white hair was arranged
very becomingly, and Alpine felt quite proud of
her mother's <i>distingué</i> appearance.</p>

<p>Alpine Belmont herself was a milk-white blonde, a
trifle below the medium height, and with a rather too decided
inclination to <i>embonpoint</i>. But the plumpness and
dimples were rather fascinating, now in the heyday of
youth&mdash;she was barely twenty&mdash;and with passable features,
pale straw-gold hair, and forget-me-not blue eyes,
Alpine passed as a belle and beauty.</p>

<p>But Kathleen Carew&mdash;Kathleen, with her slender, perfect
figure just above medium height, and her vivid face
as fresh as a flower, with her great, starry, passionate,
Oriental eyes, veiled by thick curling lashes black as starless
midnight, in such strong contrast to the rich bronze-gold
of the rippling hair that crowned her queenly little
head&mdash;Kathleen Carew was truly</p>

<p class="center">
"The Rose that all were praising."<br />
</p>

<p>"The house is crowded," Mrs. Carew observed in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
gratified tone, as she swept the brilliant horse-shoe with
her lorgnette.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course. They say Ralph Chainey is a splendid
actor," returned Alpine, as she threw back her blue-and-white
cloak to give the crowd the benefit of her plump
white arms and shoulders.</p>

<p>"Does Ralph Chainey play Prince Karl?" inquired
Kathleen, with languid interest; and, forgetting to listen
for the answer, turned her attention to the stage where the
actors were strutting their brief day.</p>

<p>The play went on, and Kathleen, rousing with a start
out of her languid mood, watched it with eager eyes.</p>

<p>Everybody knows the clever, fascinating play "Prince
Karl." Mansfield has made it immortal in his rôle of the
courier.</p>

<p>This new actor, whose name had brought out the fashionable
world of cultured Boston, was no whit behind
Mansfield in his clever impersonations. He was young,
and had flashed upon the dramatic world two years before
with the brightness of a star. Time was adding fresh
laurels to his name, and Boston, critical as it was, did
not hesitate to add its plaudits, for, be it known, Ralph
Washburn Chainey was a Bostonian "to the manor
born."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is splendid! And is he not perfectly magnificent?"
exclaimed Alpine Belmont, turning eagerly to
Kathleen, as the curtain fell upon the first act.</p>

<p>Then she started with surprise, for Kathleen was leaning
back in her chair, breathing heavily, her face very
pale, her eyes half veiled by the drooping lids.</p>

<p>"Kathleen, what is the matter? Are you going to
sleep, or are you ill, or&mdash;<i>what</i>?" she demanded, in a high
whisper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>Kathleen caught Alpine's hand and drew it against
her side.</p>

<p>"Oh, Alpine, feel my heart how it beats!" she whispered.
"I have had such a shock! Did you not recognize
him, too?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you are talking about, Kathleen."</p>

<p>"Don't you? Oh, Alpine, I have found <i>him</i> out at last&mdash;my
hero!" whispered the romantic girl.</p>

<p>"Kathleen, you're dreaming!"</p>

<p>"I'm not. I knew him in a minute, and he recognized
me, too. I saw it in his glance when his eyes met mine.
He started, then I smiled&mdash;I could not help it, I was so
glad."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carew had been listening to catch the whispered
conversation. A heavy frown darkened her face. She
leaned forward and muttered, harshly:</p>

<p>"Kathleen, you must be crazy!"</p>

<p>The girl shrugged her shoulders contemptuously, and
took no other notice of the speech.</p>

<p>But Alpine's curiosity was awakened, and she whispered,
eagerly:</p>

<p>"Where is he, then? Point him out to me."</p>

<p>"I can not. He has gone off. Wait till he returns,"
answered Kathleen, sitting up straight in her chair again.
The color was coming back into her face again, her eyes
flashed radiantly. Mrs. Carew regarded her with suppressed
displeasure.</p>

<p>Some gentlemen acquaintances came into the box, and
the subject of Kathleen's discovery was dropped. They
chatted gayly until the time for the curtain to rise, then
returned to their seats.</p>

<p>The curtain rose upon the second act of the play, and
Alpine was so interested that she leaned eagerly forward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
quite forgetting, in her keen admiration of Prince Karl,
her step-sister's interesting disclosure just now.</p>

<p>But suddenly Kathleen's taper fingers closed in a gentle
pinch upon her plump arm.</p>

<p>"Look&mdash;now&mdash;don't you recognize him?" she murmured,
triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Who? Where? Oh, for goodness' sake, Kathleen,
don't bother me now! I don't want to lose a word of
glorious Prince Karl!"</p>

<p>"But, Alpine, it is <i>he</i>, Prince Karl&mdash;my hero!"</p>

<p>"Good heavens, Kathleen! do you really mean it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do, Alpine. This Prince Karl&mdash;this Ralph
Chainey&mdash;is my rescuer at Newport last summer. Watch
him, Alpine, and perhaps you will catch him looking at us
a little consciously, as I did just now."</p>

<p>"I see the likeness <i>now</i>!" answered Alpine, in a tone
of suppressed dismay, whose import Kathleen could not
understand. She said no more to her step-sister, but sat
through the remainder of the play in a blissful dream.</p>

<p>The beautiful young heiress was intensely romantic,
and for long months her fancy had been haunted by the
image of the handsome young man who had saved her
life. To find him again in the handsome young actor
whose name was on every lip thrilled her with delight.
He had recognized her, too, and the memory of his startled
glance, so quickly withdrawn, thrilled her with keen
delight, although he did not permit her to meet his eyes
again.</p>

<p>Kathleen felt a little triumph, too, over Alpine, who
had declared that her hero was doubtless a mere nobody&mdash;perhaps
a clerk in a country store, than which position
Alpine's contemptuous ideas could not descend
lower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Alpine was watching him now with such eager interest
that Kathleen smiled and thought:</p>

<p>"I believe Alpine has fallen in love with him, herself.
But she need not; he is mine, mine, mine!"</p>

<p>She was claiming him already in her thoughts, forgetting
that she had never even spoken to the handsome
stranger to whom she owed such a debt of gratitude. It
seemed to her that she was as dear to him as he was to
her, and she almost expected to see him waiting to hand
her to her carriage when they left the theater.</p>

<p>But no; the faint, fluttering hope was soon extinguished.
Other admirers were waiting obsequiously,
eager for the honor of touching the small gloved hand of
the beautiful belle, but when the curtain dropped on
Prince Karl bowing to the applauding audience, Kathleen
saw him no more that night.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Carew dismissed her maid that night she
sent an imperative summons to her step-daughter to come
to her room, and received in return a polite request to be
excused. Kathleen was tired, and meant to retire immediately.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<p class="center">"I DISTINCTLY FORBID YOU TO KNOW THIS ACTOR," SAID
MRS. CAREW.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i26">L. E. L.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Despite the message, Mrs. Carew, who went at once to
Kathleen's room in a rage at her impertinence, found the
young girl still in her ball-dress and jewels, sitting dreamily
in an easy-chair, having dismissed Susette to arrange
her bath. She yawned sleepily at her step-mother's entrance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"I sent you word to wait till to-morrow," she said,
petulantly.</p>

<p>"I did not choose to wait, Miss Impertinence!" and
as Kathleen opened wide her big black eyes in a sort of
contemptuous amazement, Mrs. Carew continued, angrily:
"Alpine has told me how silly you were over
that actor; how you love him, and long to get acquainted
with him. Do you not know that it is very bold and
coarse for a young girl to even think of a man that way
until he has given some sign of liking for her? But
Alpine declares that this man has never even noticed
you."</p>

<p>"Alpine is a sneaking tell-tale, and you are a cruel
woman!" Kathleen answered, indignantly. "And,
madame, if I am ignorant, as you charge, of the proper
feeling to observe toward men, who is to blame for that?
Why did you not train me as carefully as you did your
daughter Alpine? You took my poor dead mother's place
before I was two years old. Why did you not do your
duty by her orphan child?"</p>

<p>"How dare you speak to me like this?" demanded the
angry woman. "Be silent, and listen to my commands!"</p>

<p>Her fingers itched to slap the cheek that dimpled with
insolent amusement, but she clinched her hand and went
on:</p>

<p>"Your father left you in my care when he went abroad
for his health, and you shall obey my commands while
he is gone. If you dare defy me, I shall lock you in
your room, on bread and water, till you beg my pardon."</p>

<p>There was no answer. Kathleen looked her indignation,
that was all.</p>

<p>"I distinctly forbid," said Mrs. Carew, "any further
nonsense over this actor. Good heavens! an <i>actor</i>!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
What would your haughty father say?" contemptuously.
"I will not take you to the theater again while he plays
here. You disgraced yourself to-night, making eyes at
him on the stage, and there shall be no more of it. I
shall not permit him to make your acquaintance, even if
he seeks to do so, which is very doubtful, as"&mdash;scornfully&mdash;"the
infatuation seems to be all on one side."</p>

<p>Kathleen writhed with mortification, but she did not
permit her foe to see how cruelly she was wounded.
She held her queenly little head erect with that silent
smile of maddening amusement on her scarlet lips. Years
of wrong and injustice had made her scorn this woman
who filled her dead mother's place so unworthily, and
she made few efforts to conceal her feelings.</p>

<p>"I forbid any acquaintance with this Ralph Chainey&mdash;this
actor. Do you understand me, Kathleen?" repeated
her step-mother.</p>

<p>"I have heard you," answered the young girl, with a
mutinous pout of her full lip.</p>

<p>"You will obey me?" a little anxiously, for Kathleen
had never been so aggressively rebellious as to-night.</p>

<p>At the question, Kathleen rose to her feet and stood
up like a young lioness at bay.</p>

<p>"I will <i>not</i> obey you, madame!" she replied.</p>

<p>"What?" almost shrieked Mrs. Carew.</p>

<p>"I will not obey you!" she repeated, with flashing
eyes. "I will not run after Mr. Chainey, as you pretend
so falsely that I am doing, and I will make no unmaidenly
overtures toward his acquaintance, but if the proper opportunity
offers for me to know and thank him for saving
my life, I shall surely avail myself of it!"</p>

<p>They stood glaring at each other, the girl roused into
furious rebellion, the woman speechless with fury, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
steel-blue eyes seeming to emit electric sparks from her
deathly white face, so intense was her fierce wrath. Controlling
herself with an effort, she turned to leave the
room, and, pausing on the threshold, hissed back one
significant sentence at the defiant girl:</p>

<p>"Forewarned is forearmed!"</p>

<p>"I do not fear you!" Kathleen answered; but Mrs.
Carew never looked back.</p>

<p>"What will she do? What can she do? She will never
dare lock me in my room, as she threatened!" Kathleen
murmured, uneasily, and then her overstrained nerves
gave way. She threw herself on the bed and sobbed
aloud, in nervous abandonment to her outraged feelings.</p>

<p>God help that poor, motherless girl! She knew that
the events of that night would only make her life harder
than it had been before under the roof that her step-mother
ruled with an iron hand.</p>

<p>The beautiful young heiress did not have a happy life,
in spite of all the good gifts with which fate had so richly
dowered her at her birth. Her step-mother had always
hated her, and never relaxed her efforts to harden her
father's heart against his only child. Perhaps she hated
Kathleen the more because Heaven had denied any
children to her second marriage, and she knew that to this
girl would go the bulk of her father's great wealth.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carew had two children by her first marriage&mdash;a
son, now twenty-three, called Ivan, and the girl Alpine.
Her favorite scheme was to marry the hated Kathleen to
this son, so that he might share her rich inheritance.
Failing in this, she meant, if it lay in the power of a
human devil to compass it, to have Kathleen disgraced
and disinherited, so that she and her children might enjoy
the whole of the great Carew fortune.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Alas, that clouds should ever steal<br /></span>

</div></div>


<p>Mrs. Carew did not appear at breakfast the next morning
and Alpine, with a reproachful glance at Kathleen,
said that mamma was sick. She had been so worried last
night that she could not sleep, and this morning she had
such a terrible headache that she must lie abed all day.</p>

<p>Kathleen did not look either repentant or sorry. She
simply said that in that case she would not practice her
music this morning, and went off to her own little studio,
where she painted a while with great ardor, then threw
down her brush, and rang for Susette to bring up the
morning papers.</p>

<p>Susette lingered a minute after she had put down the
newspapers.</p>

<p>"Miss Kathleen, I don't think it will disturb Mrs.
Carew the least bit if you practice your music," she said,
significantly.</p>

<p>"But her head aches, Susette."</p>

<p>"No, it don't miss; she's not in the house, so there!
She went away early&mdash;very early, in her traveling-dress,
the Lord knows where; for James told me so on the sly."
(James was the butler, and Susette's sweetheart.)</p>

<p>Kathleen looked a little startled as she said:</p>

<p>"You must be mistaken. Ellen has been with her mistress
all day. I tapped at the door a while ago to ask how
she was, and she reported Mrs. Carew as very low."</p>

<p>"They are all deceiving you, Miss Kathleen, but what
for I don't know, only I'm sure and certain she ain't
in this house," protested Susette, stoutly.</p>

<p>"Very well, Susette. Her absence has no more interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
for me than her presence," Kathleen answered,
indifferently, as she opened <i>The Globe</i> and read the encomiums
on Ralph Chainey's acting that filled a critical
half column.</p>

<p>Her eyes sparkled and her cheeks glowed with pleasure.</p>

<p>"He plays 'Prince Karl' again to-night. Oh if I
only could go again!" she thought, regretfully; then,
throwing down the paper, she decided she would go and
practice her music, since Mrs. Carew was not ill, as
Alpine pretended.</p>

<p>She had played but a few bars when Alpine entered
with reproachful eyes.</p>

<p>"Have you no feeling, Kathleen? You will kill
mamma!"</p>

<p>"Since mamma went away this morning early and
has not yet returned, there's no danger," Kathleen answered,
coolly.</p>

<p>"It is false! Who told you so?"</p>

<p>"No matter how I found it out. I'm in possession of
the mysterious fact."</p>

<p>"It's that prying Susette, I know! I shall advise
mamma to dismiss her immediately."</p>

<p>"You'd better not, Alpine. Susette knows some of
your <i>secrets</i>!" Kathleen answered, with a provoking
laugh.</p>

<p>"I have no secrets!" snapped Alpine; but she left the
room discomfited.</p>

<p>Kathleen practiced and read until the late luncheon,
where she was surprised to find herself alone.</p>

<p>"Where is Miss Belmont, James?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Miss Belmont went out for a walk," he answered,
respectfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>While Kathleen was making up her mind to go for a
walk, too, some callers were announced. She received
the matron and her two gay young daughters, entertained
them herself, with an apology for the absence of the
other members of the family, and saw them depart with a
sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"I will go for my walk now," she decided, but turning
from the piano, she saw an open note lying on the floor.
Her own name attracted her, and picking it up, she read,
under date of that morning:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Alpine and Kathleen</span>&mdash;Mamma wishes you
to join us at an informal three-o'clock lunch to-day, to
meet a distinguished guest. Brother George was at college
with Prince Karl&mdash;Ralph Chainey, you know&mdash;and
he is coming here to lunch with us to-day. Do come,
girls! He's so handsome and talented I want you both
to know him. There will be several others, too, but we
want you especially. I want him to see our beautiful
Kathleen."</p></blockquote>

<p>The note bore the name of Helen Fox, one of their
intimate girl friends, and Kathleen realized in a minute
that she had been tricked by crafty Alpine, who had gone
to the luncheon alone to meet Ralph Chainey.</p>

<p>A futile sob of bitter disappointment rose in the girl's
throat, and crushing the note in her hand, she walked
to the window, gazing blankly out into the handsome
street through burning tears.</p>

<p>A light laugh startled her. There was Alpine Belmont,
in elegant attire, walking toward the gate with a
tall, handsome, <i>distingué</i> young man. Lifting his hat with
a smile, he left the young lady there, and walked away
with a hasty backward glance at the window that showed
him a lovely, woful face staring in undisguised wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
at the spectacle of Ralph Chainey walking home with deceitful
Alpine Belmont.</p>

<p>"Alpine, you wicked girl, how could you treat me so
unfairly?" she demanded, shaking with passion.</p>

<p>Alpine flung herself into a chair, flushed, laughing, insolent.</p>

<p>"You told mamma last night that I was a sneaking
tell-tale, didn't you? Well, then, I paid you off, that's
all! Besides, mamma does not allow you to know Ralph
Chainey&mdash;a pity for you, my poor Kathleen, for he's the
most fascinating young man I ever met. I made myself
very agreeable to him, and I think he fell in love with me.
You see yourself he walked home with me from Helen's
luncheon. Would you like to know what I told him about
you, my charming Kathleen?"</p>

<p>"No!" the girl answered, hotly.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you&mdash;you're dying to hear. Well, it
was this: I said you did not recognize him in the least
last night till I told you it was the man that saved you at
Newport. Then I said you would not come to meet him
at the luncheon to-day, because you said it would be such
a bore having to thank him. Ha, ha! You'd like to murder
me, I know!"</p>

<p class="center">KATHLEEN'S DEFIANCE.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She went her way with a strong step and slow&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her pressed lip arched, and her clear eye undimmed,<br /></span>

<span class="i26"><span class="smcap">N. P. Willis</span>.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Helen Fox was one of those sweet, pretty, amiable
girls that everybody loves. Her rosy lips were always
wreathed in smiles, and the very glance of her roguish
blue eyes invited confidence. She was the most popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
girl in her set, and the intimate friend of Kathleen
Carew and Alpine Belmont.</p>

<p>Warm-hearted Helen had been sadly disappointed because
Kathleen had not come to the luncheon, and the
excuse that Alpine offered&mdash;namely, that her step-sister
could not tear herself away from a new novel&mdash;seemed
too shallow to entertain.</p>

<p>"I'm really mad with Kathleen, the lazy thing!" she
said, frankly, to Ralph Chainey, who smiled, but made
no comment. He was thinking about what Miss Belmont
had told him just now. It rankled in his mind.</p>

<p>"I am anxious for you to meet her, she is such a
beauty!" continued Helen, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>He gave some flattering answer that made her dimple
and blush, but she answered, with a careless glance
around:</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, we girls are well enough; but wait till you
see my bonny Kathleen. Such lips, such hair, such
eyes!"</p>

<p>Ralph Chainey laughed.</p>

<p>"You needn't be so sarcastic, Mr. Chainey. You
haven't seen our beauty yet."</p>

<p>"I saw her last night at the theater."</p>

<p>"Oh, so you did. I forgot that. Well, isn't she
charming?"</p>

<p>The handsome actor replied with a quotation:</p>

<p>
"'Perfectly beautiful, faultily faultless.'"<br />
</p>

<p>"She is all that," Helen Fox replied; but she looked
at him with puzzled eyes, and thought within herself
that he was somehow piqued at Kathleen Carew. But
why, since the two had never met?</p>

<p>Suddenly the reason presented itself to her mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"The great vain thing! He is piqued because the
beauty didn't come to the luncheon. He is offended because
she did not seem anxious to meet him."</p>

<p>And she was secretly amused at the young actor's palpable
vanity, regarding it as a good joke, little dreaming
of the seed that Alpine Belmont had been sowing in
his mind.</p>

<p>Many envious glances followed Alpine, a little later,
when she bore Ralph Chainey off in triumph as her escort
home; but Helen was pleased, for she thought:</p>

<p>"If Alpine asks him into the house he will get acquainted
with Kathleen, and then he will find out how
lovable she is."</p>

<p>But when George Fox, who had also walked home with
a young lady on Commonwealth Avenue, returned home
he reported that Ralph Chainey had left Miss Belmont
at the door.</p>

<p>Suddenly Helen remembered sundry small matters
that were not at all to Alpine's credit.</p>

<p>"That girl is tricky, I know," she said to herself.
"Perhaps she did not ask Mr. Chainey to go in. Perhaps
she kept Kathleen from coming here to-day. She
has been known to do shabby things to cut other girls
out of their lovers. Not that Ralph Chainey is Kathleen's
lover <i>yet</i>, but he ought to be. They are just suited
to each other, both are so splendid. It may be that Alpine
intends to catch him herself before her sister gets a
chance." Helen laughed a sage little laugh to herself, and
added: "I'll ask mamma to let us call at Mrs. Carew's
and take Kathleen with us to the theater to-night."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Oh, Alpine! where is Kathleen? George and mamma
are waiting out here in the carriage. We have just one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
seat left, and we stopped to ask Kathleen to go with us
to the theater."</p>

<p>"Mamma is out, Helen, and she would not like it if
Kathleen went without leave."</p>

<p>"But mamma is with us, Alpine. She would chaperon
Kathleen."</p>

<p>"She can not possibly go," began Alpine, in a high tone
of authority; but at that moment a light swish of silken
draperies came through the hall, and a sweet voice said,
clearly:</p>

<p>"Kathleen <i>can</i> go, Helen, and she <i>will</i> go, too, if you
will wait till she gets on her things."</p>

<p>And Alpine beheld her step-sister, cool, calm, defiant,
rustle up to Helen Fox and kiss that piquant, silk-robed
damsel.</p>

<p>"Come upstairs with me, Helen, dear, while I dress,"
she said, radiantly, trying to draw her toward the stairway,
for this colloquy had taken place in the hall.</p>

<p>Alpine followed them upstairs out of reach of the
servants' ears, and then she said, sharply:</p>

<p>"You need not get ready, Kathleen, for I shall assume
mamma's authority in her absence, and forbid your
going."</p>

<p>"Oh, Alpine, where is the harm?" pleaded Helen.</p>

<p>"Mamma has forbidden her to go to the theater any
more this week, because she caught her making eyes at
an actor on the stage last night," Alpine answered, maliciously.</p>

<p>"It is false!" answered the young girl, stung to madness
by Alpine's wickedness. Turning to Helen, she
said, proudly: "I accept your invitation, Helen, and will
accompany you to the theater, in spite of a hundred Alpine
Belmonts! I am no slave to be domineered over in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
this manner, and Alpine had better go and leave me alone
before she arouses me any further."</p>

<p>"Very well, miss; take your own way and defy <i>me</i>; but
mamma will make you repent it, be sure of that," snapped
Alpine, withdrawing.</p>

<p>"Oh, Kathleen, I didn't know I was going to raise such
a breeze! Perhaps you had better not go if Mrs. Carew
objects," Helen said, uneasily.</p>

<p>Kathleen turned on her a face crimson with angry
passion.</p>

<p>"I'd go if she killed me for it!" she cried, with an
imperious stamp of her dainty foot. "Who is that
woman to forbid my going to places of amusement, like
other girls?" She rang the bell violently for Susette,
and added: "Say nothing before my maid, Helen; but
on our way to the theater I'll tell you how wickedly
Alpine treated me this afternoon."</p>

<p>Presently Alpine, peeping through her door, saw the
two girls going away, Helen a little uneasy looking, the
other proud, defiant, beautiful as a dream.</p>

<p>"She will meet Ralph Chainey, after all," Alpine muttered,
in a fury.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was midnight when Mrs. Fox's carriage stopped
again at the Carew mansion, and George handed Kathleen
out and rang the bell for her at her own door.</p>

<p>The windows were closed, and not the faintest gleam
of light shone through them. George waited a few moments,
then rang the bell again.</p>

<p>"Every one must be asleep, they are so long coming,"
said Kathleen, shivering in the cold night air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>They rang again furiously; but there was no response.
The locked door, the dark, forbidding windows seemed
to frown on their frantic efforts to arouse the house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fox put her head out of the carriage window
and said:</p>

<p>"Kathleen, you had better come home with us to-night,
my dear. I don't think you will be able to rouse any one
there; and you will catch cold waiting in the cool night
air."</p>

</div></div>


<p>Kathleen was annoyed by her failure to get into the
house, but she did not attach any particular significance
to it. She supposed that Alpine, out of spite, had caused
the servants to lock up and go to bed; that was all. She
went home willingly enough with her kind friends, intending
to return the next morning.</p>

<p>And when she laid her beautiful head on the pillow
that night, it was to dream of soft brown eyes that had
looked thrillingly into hers, and of a warm white hand
that had clasped hers, oh! so closely, when he said good-night;
for Ralph Chainey, the actor&mdash;or Prince Karl, as
Kathleen called him in her thoughts&mdash;had come into Mrs.
Fox's box twice between the acts, and had been presented
to the beautiful heiress whose life he had saved last summer,
and from whose presence he had gone away <i>incognito</i>.</p>

<p>Prince Karl had been on his dignity at first. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
remembered what Alpine Belmont had told him that afternoon.</p>

<p>He believed that beautiful Kathleen was cold, proud
and ungrateful.</p>

<p>So, after bowing over her little hand when George Fox
presented them, he turned his attention to the vivacious
Helen, and scarcely looked at the radiant creature close
to her side.</p>

<p>Kathleen bit her red lips and remained silent. She understood
Ralph Chainey's mood, and knew that she had
to thank Alpine for his indifference.</p>

<p>Her sweet lips quivered with a repressed sob, and her
dark eyes swam in moisture that threatened to fall in
blinding tears. It was hard&mdash;cruelly hard to have him
believe her proud and ungrateful, and to see him resent
it in this cavalier fashion.</p>

<p>He bowed himself out presently, and then Helen Fox
turned to her, eagerly.</p>

<p>"How did you like him, Kathleen? Isn't he just splendid?"
she exclaimed. Then she saw how grave and quiet
the young girl looked, and remembered what Kathleen
had told her in the carriage. "Oh! I forgot; he did not
really pass one word with you. He was piqued and stiff
over what Alpine told him," she cried, and added, consolingly:
"Never mind; he'll come round. He admires
you very much&mdash;I saw that in his eyes&mdash;and, of course,
he is secretly very much interested in you, having saved
your life! It is very romantic, Kathleen, and I shouldn't
wonder if it's a match."</p>

<p>"Don't, Helen!" answered the girl, somewhat incoherently.</p>

<p>But Helen laughed gayly, and when the next act was
over and the actor came again for a few minutes, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
found her whispering very mysteriously to her mother.
She nodded at him, and went on confiding something to
her mother's ear.</p>

<p>George Fox had gone out, so there was no one to speak
to but Kathleen&mdash;trembling Kathleen&mdash;who blushed
warmly when he came to her side, and murmured, tremulously:</p>

<p>"I want to thank you for&mdash;for last summer. It was
so good of you, so noble, to risk your life for a&mdash;a
stranger."</p>

<p>"Pray do not speak of it; it was nothing. I ran no
risk; I am a good swimmer," he replied, a little stiffly.</p>

<p>But Kathleen went on, in that tremulous voice:</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I have always remembered you with gratitude&mdash;always
longed to see you again, that I might thank you
from my heart for your goodness. Papa, too, wanted to
see you. Why did you go away so suddenly?"</p>

<p>Where was the arrogance, the indifference on which
Alpine had expatiated? The sweet lips trembled; there
was dew on the curling black lashes that shaded the splendid,
luring black eyes. When Ralph Chainey had gazed
into them a moment, he turned away his head like one
dazzled by too much sunlight.</p>

<p>"Why did you go away so suddenly?" she repeated;
and then he said:</p>

<p>"It was because I am an actor, Miss Carew. If I had
stayed to receive your thanks, and disclosed my identity,
the story would have got into the newspapers, and people
would have said I did it to get some free advertising.
Your name would have gone all over the country as the
heroine of the rescue. You would not have liked the
publicity, perhaps; and so I hurried away."</p>

<p>"It was very good of you to think of that," she answered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
simply; then added hastily, for the minutes were
passing, and she knew he must soon return to the stage
again: "Mr. Chainey, Alpine told me what she had told
you this afternoon. It was&mdash;was&mdash;a joke on her part.
I <i>did</i> recognize you last night as soon as I saw you.
I told her who you were. She was jesting, believe me
for I&mdash;I could not&mdash;be so ungrateful as to forget your
face so soon."</p>

<p>It was time for him to go. He rose and held out his
hand.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said, in his deep, sweet voice, pressing
her hand warmly. His magnetic brown eyes gazed
deep into hers, and he murmured, inaudibly to the others:
"It was the happiest moment I ever knew when I saved
your life!"</p>

<p>Then he was gone. From the stage she met his eyes
twice fixed on her, as if he could not resist the temptation
of looking. When George Fox put them all into
their carriage, he came out, still in his stage costume,
to say good-night. He held her hand just a moment
longer than Helen's, and he whispered:</p>

<p>"I hope we shall meet again."</p>

<p>His eyes, his words, his thrilling hand-clasp, haunted
the motherless girl that night in the mystical land of
dreams.</p>

<p>She arose early, after a rather restless night, and her
first thought was that she had no morning-dress.</p>

<p>"I am taller than Helen, so I can not wear one of
hers; neither can I wear the low-necked costume I wore
to the theater last night," she murmured, in perplexity.</p>

<p>Her musings were cut short by a tap at the door.
Susette, her maid, entered with a large bundle.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Miss Kathleen. I've brought your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
walking-dress for you to come home," she said, undoing
the paper and displaying a black silk costume.</p>

<p>"Oh! how good of you, Susette! I was just thinking
I would have to ask Mrs. Fox to send around for it."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Carew sent me," said Susette, pursing her lips.</p>

<p>"So she has returned?" asked Kathleen, resting her
charming head on her elbow and looking down at the
maid, who had seated herself on an ottoman close to
the bed.</p>

<p>"She came home near midnight last night, Miss Kathleen."</p>

<p>"Near midnight? Why, then, some one must have
been awake when I came home, Susette! Why did no one
answer the bell?"</p>

<p>"The madame's orders," Susette replied, significantly.</p>

<p>The great dark eyes of Kathleen dilated in wonder.</p>

<p>"But why&mdash;&mdash;" she began, and the maid interrupted:</p>

<p>"Miss Kathleen, I did some eavesdropping on your
account last night, and if you'll not think the worse of me
for it, I'll tell you Mrs. Carew's plans."</p>

<p>The woman was rather intelligent and quite well educated
for one in her position. She had been in Kathleen's
service five years, and loved her young mistress
dearly. Her devotion to her interests had won her a
warm place in Kathleen's heart.</p>

<p>"Go on," she said, and Susette continued:</p>

<p>"When madame went away yesterday it was somewhere
into the country where there's a boarding-school,
where you are to be sent to-day."</p>

<p>"Susette!"</p>

<p>"It's the gospel truth, miss! They packed your trunk
last night, all ready for you to start. That's why they
wouldn't let you in. You were not to know anything."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"To&mdash;send&mdash;me&mdash;back&mdash;to&mdash;school!" exclaimed the
young girl in such amazement that the words came with
difficulty from her lips. Her eyes flashed with anger.
"I will not go! She can not force me!" she declared.</p>

<p>"She intends to <i>make</i> you go. I heard her tell Miss
Belmont so," said the maid, looking very sad, for she
knew that Mrs. Carew's will was law.</p>

<p>Kathleen's face grew scarlet with passion, and there
was a dangerous light in her eyes, but she did not answer.
Springing from the couch, she allowed Susette to attire
her in her black silk.</p>

<p>"I thought maybe if I told you beforehand that maybe
you could think of some way to outwit her," said the
maid.</p>

<p>"And I will&mdash;I <i>will</i>! I will never be sent to school
again!" cried the girl, in something almost like terror.
She clasped her little hands and sighed: "Oh, why did
papa ever go away and leave me here in that woman's
power? She was always cruel to me, but she did not
dare so much while he was here. Oh, I wish he would
come home to his poor Kathleen!"</p>

<p>Bitter burning tears rolled down her cheeks and
dropped on her heaving bosom. It was so hard to be
ruled by this coarse woman, who envied and hated her in
the same breath.</p>

<p>"She is going to make you marry her son, too. She
told her daughter that she was determined to bring that
about, so he might share your fortune," Susette remarked
at this juncture.</p>

<p>Before Kathleen could reply, the door opened softly
and Helen Fox came in with two letters in her hand.
Kissing Kathleen good morning, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"What do you think? The postman has just brought
me a proposal!"</p>

<p>"From Loyal Graham?" queried her friend.</p>

<p>Helen blushed up to her eyes, but answered, gayly:</p>

<p>"No, indeed&mdash;from Teddy Darrell."</p>

<p>Kathleen arched her black eyebrows in surprise.</p>

<p>"Teddy Darrell! Why, he proposed to <i>me</i> last week,"
she said.</p>

<p>"And did he ask you to keep it a <i>secret</i>?" asked
Helen, consulting her letter, her blue eyes dancing with
fun.</p>

<p>"Yes, he did, now that I recall it. Oh, my! I'm
sorry I mentioned it; but you took me by surprise."</p>

<p>"There's no harm done, my dear, and you need not
look so conscience-stricken. Bless you, I don't mean to
keep it a secret, although he prays me here to do so.
Why, Teddy Darrell is the worst flirt in Boston, and proposes
to a new girl every week, always trying to keep the
new love a secret from the old one."</p>

<p>"But does no one ever accept him, Helen?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps. I don't know, I'm sure I sha'n't, and I'm
just dying to tell the girls. Why, only last week we were
comparing notes over him, and out of seven girls in the
crowd he had asked five to marry him. Maud Sylvester
said I'd be the next one on his list, and you see I am."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>"But how can he fall in love so often?" queried Kathleen,
laughing.</p>

<p>"He's very susceptible, I suppose, or maybe it's all
in fun. You know some young men like to be engaged
to several girls at once, so they can boast of their conquests,
and maybe he's one of them. Well, I must lacerate
his poor heart by a refusal," with a mock sigh.</p>

<p>"Who will be his next victim?" asked Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Either Maud Sylvester or Katie Wells. One is an
actress, the other a novelist. He is wild over both fraternities."</p>

<p>"How amusing!" laughed her friend. "But your
other letter, Helen? Is it another proposal?"</p>

<p>"No; this is an invitation to attend a flower show."</p>

<p>"From Loyal Graham?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es," Helen answered, a little consciously. "But,
Kathleen, how pale you are! Did you not sleep well?"</p>

<p>"No; I was restless," answered the girl.</p>

<p>She debated within herself whether she ought to tell
Helen of the news Susette had brought. She concluded
that she would not just yet.</p>

<p>"Come, we will go down to breakfast, dear," Helen
said, drawing an arm through Kathleen's to lead her away.</p>

<p>"Susette, you need not go back yet. I shall want you
after a while," said Kathleen, and the maid remained
very willingly.</p>

<p>Down-stairs Kathleen smiled, talked, ate, and drank in
a mechanical fashion. She was busy revolving schemes
for escaping her threatening fate.</p>

<p>Kathleen had not been home from school more than
six months. The idea of returning to it, and leaving the
social whirl, that as yet was so new and charming, was
not to be tolerated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>"And just as I had met Ralph Chainey, too," she said
to herself, in keen dismay.</p>

<p>Her mind was on a rack of torture. She was afraid
that open rebellion would not avail. Her foe was keen
and subtle. She would employ strategy to compass her
ends.</p>

<p>"I ought to meet her with her own weapons," she
thought; and all at once she began to wonder if she could
not quietly get away and go South to her dead mother's
relatives, there to remain until the return of her father
should make her safe from persecution.</p>

<p>Two hours later Kathleen bade her friends good-morning,
and walked away with Susette, as they supposed,
toward her home. Little did Helen Fox, as she gazed
with loving eyes after her beautiful form, dream of the
tragic doom hanging over Kathleen Carew.</p>

<p>"Susette, I am not going home with you," she said.</p>

<p>The maid looked inquiringly into the beautiful young
face, and Kathleen added, determinedly:</p>

<p>"I am going straight to the station, where I shall take
the train and go South to my mother's relatives, to remain
until papa gets back to free me from that woman's
tyranny."</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Kathleen! do you think that will be for the
best?" inquired Susette, timorously.</p>

<p>"Of course it will, Susette; for they will be kind to
me for my dead mother's sake."</p>

<p>"And you will have me to pet you and care for you?"
said the affectionate maid.</p>

<p>"I can not take you with me, Susette; for it might get
you into trouble, you good soul, and I don't want to do
that. I can take care of myself, never fear. No, you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
to go straight back home and say that I sent you, and will
follow presently."</p>

<p>Susette began to sob dismally, and Kathleen had to
draw her aside into a pretty little park where they seated
themselves, and talked softly for some time. Then Kathleen
arose, and pressed her sweet rosy lips to the woman's
wet cheeks.</p>

<p>"Now good-bye for a few weeks only, Susette, dear;
for as soon as papa returns I'll be back. If Mrs. Carew
turns you out, go to Helen Fox and ask her to give you
employment while I am away. She will do it for my
sake, I know. And I'll write to you at Helen's as soon as
I get to Richmond. How fortunate that I have my diamonds
with me, for I can go to the jeweler's and sell
enough to carry me on my journey. Oh, Susette, don't
sob so, please, dear! Good-bye; God bless you!" She
signaled a passing cab, gave the order: "Golden &amp; Glitter's,
Tremont Street," and was driven swiftly away.</p>

<p>It was a bright, cool morning in April, and Tremont
Street was thronged with shoppers and business people as
she stepped out of the cab in front of the jeweler's elegant
shop.</p>

<p>Bidding the cab wait, the young girl drew down her lace
veil and entered without noticing, in her preoccupation,
the tall, blonde young man, with a small satchel in his
hand, who was intently gazing into the jeweler's window
with a covetous gleam in his pale, dull-blue eyes.</p>

<p>But the young man's eyes turned aside from the contemplation
of the treasures displayed within the heavy
plate-glass window and fastened on the beautiful young
girl with her patrician air and elegant costume.</p>

<p>"Kathleen, as I live!" he exclaimed, with a violent
start, and followed her stealthily into the shop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>The elegant place was thronged with shoppers, and he
mingled with them, keeping close to Kathleen, although
unobserved by the object of his espionage.</p>

<p>"I wish I had the money that lucky girl is going to
spend!" he muttered, enviously, to himself.</p>

<p>Kathleen went immediately to the desk of Mr. Golden,
the senior partner of the firm. Drawing a small black
case from her pocket, she opened it, displaying a very
pretty diamond necklace.</p>

<p>"Mr. Golden, of course you remember when papa
bought this necklace here for me," she said, timidly. "He
paid five thousand dollars for it, you know. Well, papa
is away"&mdash;with a catch in her breath&mdash;"and&mdash;I&mdash;I need
some money very much. Will you do me the favor of
buying this back for whatever you will give me?"</p>

<p>The kindly white-haired gentleman, drew a check toward
him and began to write rapidly.</p>

<p>"Will a thousand dollars do you, my dear young lady?
Because you can take that, and leave the necklace as security
for the loan. You can redeem it when your
father gets back," he said, beaming genially upon her, for
the Carews were among his best customers.</p>

</div></div>


<p>When Kathleen had thanked Mr. Golden for his ready
kindness, and gratefully accepted the check, she hastened
to the bank, on the next block, and had it cashed in some
large and a few bills of smaller denomination. She had
left Cabby waiting for her in front of the jewelers, telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
him that as soon as she returned from the bank she
wanted him to drive her to the station, to take the first
train for the South.</p>

<p>Accordingly, she returned in a few minutes and sprung
into the cab, little dreaming that she was watched and followed
by the tall, blonde young man who had recognized
her when she had alighted at Golden &amp; Glitter's, and followed
her into the store.</p>

<p>He had secured a cab for himself, and was following
fast upon her track.</p>

<p>"Now, what is up with the heiress? Must be an elopement.
Egad! Alpine told me she was in love with a
handsome actor, and that the <i>mater</i> was going to take
her back to school to save her for me. Deuce take her!
I don't want her, only for the money she'll get from
old Carew. I was always afraid of those snapping black
eyes of hers. I'd rather have that little blue-eyed New
York ballet dancer of mine, in spite of her extravagance.
A thousand dollars&mdash;a cool thousand! That's what the
little minx wants me to give her now, or&mdash;&mdash;But I
won't think of that; it makes me savage. A thousand
dollars! That's what Kathleen Carew has in her purse
this moment, besides the diamond on her finger, and her
ear-rings&mdash;real diamonds inside the little gold balls she
wears snapped over them in daytime. I wish I had 'em
for my little duck! Wouldn't she be sweet with great
sparklers in her pink ears! And to think that the <i>mater</i>
refused me the check I begged her for this morning, and
she rolling in old Carew's money, while her only son could
not keep up any style at all only for gambling!" ran the
tenor of his thoughts, as he pursued hapless Kathleen to
the station, making up his mind that she was about to
elope, and grimly determining that she should purchase his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
silence with her money and jewels. "And cheap getting
off like that, when I might take her back to mother and
keep her for myself. Egad! maybe the actor will pay me
something on his own account; d&mdash;n the lucky rascal!"
he muttered.</p>

<p>To his amazement, no person met Kathleen at the station.
She bought her ticket alone, and entered the parlor
car of the vestibule train going South.</p>

<p>"To Richmond, hey? Running away alone, and to
those poor relations of hers, I'll be bound. No chance,
then, of getting any of her boodle for my dearie. She
will need it all, for they say the Franklyns, her mother's
relations, are poor as Job's turkey hen. Well, I'll follow,
and we'll see if anything turns up to my advantage;"
and, buying a ticket as far as Philadelphia, he entered
the train, after first disguising himself by taking from
his hand satchel and putting on a dark wig and dark,
heavy whiskers.</p>

<p>The train rushed on and on through the land; but
Kathleen, sobbing under her veil, took no heed of time.
Day passed, and it was far into the night. The train
rushed into a lonely woodland station, snorted and
stopped, while the conductor shouted:</p>

<p>"Passengers for the South change cars here!"</p>

<p>Kathleen and a single gentleman seemed the only
Southern passengers. They groped their way out into
the darkness of the starless night. The other train was
waiting on the other side of a small wooden depot. Kathleen,
confused by the strangeness and darkness, staggered
shiveringly forward on the muddy path, alone, and frightened
at the solitude.</p>

<p>A stealthy step behind her, two throttling hands at her
throat smothering her startled cry. She was thrown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
violently down, the jewels wrenched from her hands and
ears, the purse from her dress; then the black-hearted
murderer fled toward the waiting train, leaving his victim
for dead upon the ground.</p>

<p>Kathleen lay still and white under the starless sky,
like one dead, and there was no one to come to her rescue,
for the telegraph operator, busy at his instrument,
dreamed not of her proximity, and at this hour of the
night there were no loiterers about in the village. Swiftly
and silently had the fiend escaped, and it was most probable
that day would dawn ere any one would discover the
beautiful girl lying out there in the rear of the depot
upon the damp, muddy ground, dead and cold.</p>

<p>But to return to Boston, which our heroine had so
unceremoniously quitted.</p>

<p>Her last thought as the train steamed away with her
was of Ralph Chainey, the handsome actor, who had
looked so tenderly into her eyes, and who had whispered
as he held her hand at parting: "I hope we shall meet
again."</p>

<p>Her tears had started at the memory.</p>

<p>"It is all over," she sighed. "He will be gone away
from Boston before I go back, and I shall never see him
again."</p>

<p>But at that very moment events were shaping themselves
in Ralph Chainey's life so as to bring him to her
side again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>In his room at the Thorndike Hotel he was reading a
telegram that said:</p>

<p>"Come at once. Fedora is ill&mdash;perhaps dying."</p>

<p>His handsome face grew grave and troubled. Throwing
down the telegram, he sought his manager.</p>

<p>"Every engagement for this week must be canceled.
I must go South on the first train."</p>

<p>"But, my dear Mr. Chainey, the loss will amount to
thousands of dollars," expostulated the reluctant manager.</p>

<p>"No matter; let the loss be mine. A&mdash;some one&mdash;is&mdash;ill&mdash;dying.
I must go."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry. We were having a splendid success
here," sighed the manager; but his regrets did not
deter the young man from going.</p>

<p>Two hours after Kathleen had left Boston, he drove
up to the same station where she had taken the train for
the South, and entered another one going in the same
direction.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Susette sauntered back to Beacon Street
with the message Kathleen had dictated&mdash;she would be at
home later on.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carew was indignant. She had been planning
to take Kathleen away by the noon train. Her trunk,
already strapped and corded, stood in the hall.</p>

<p>Susette received a severe scolding for leaving her
young mistress, but she did not seem much affected by it.</p>

<p>"She is my mistress, and I should not dare to disobey
her orders," she replied, and walked out of the room.</p>

<p>"What shall you do now?" asked Alpine, curiously.</p>

<p>"I must wait and take her on a later train."</p>

<p>Ringing a bell, she sent her own maid to Commonwealth
Avenue, to bring home her tardy step-daughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>Ellen returned with the news that Kathleen had left
Mrs. Fox's several hours ago.</p>

<p>"And with Susette, too," said the elderly maid, sourly;
for she cherished a secret grudge against Kathleen's maid,
who was younger than herself, better looking, and had
insnared the affections of James, the butler.</p>

<p>Susette was recalled. On being questioned, she readily
admitted that Kathleen had started home with her, but
sent her on ahead, promising to follow.</p>

<p>While the angry step-mother stormed and raved over
Kathleen's willfulness, awaiting her return in impotent
anger, the young girl was flying fast from her tyranny,
and nearer to the fate that loomed darkly in the near
future.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The flying train sped on through the night with Ralph
Chainey. He had thrown himself down dressed upon his
berth, for the porter had told him that he would have to
change cars at midnight.</p>

<p>He was restless and troubled. No sleep visited his
eyes. In spite of himself, his thought turned back to
Boston&mdash;to Kathleen Carew. She haunted him with her
musical voice and luring eyes. At last a deep groan
forced itself through his lips.</p>

<p>"I would to Heaven we had never met!" he exclaimed,
in a tone of deep despair.</p>

<p>Pushing back the light curtain, he looked out into the
night. It had grown cold and bleak. A light patter of
mingled rain and snow was beating against the window.</p>

<p>"How dreary!" the young man murmured, with a
shudder; and added, in a sort of awe: "Dying! can that
be true?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>The porter, who was very attentive&mdash;the result of a
liberal tip&mdash;came and put his head between the curtains.</p>

<p>"We change cars at the next station, Mr. Chainey, and
that's but a few miles away. You'd better be getting
ready."</p>

<p>Ralph came into the little reception-room, and the man
assisted him into his overcoat. A few minutes more,
and the train was slowing up at the lonely station.</p>

<p>"You're the only person getting off, sir. Good-night,
sir; a pleasant journey!"</p>

<p>The porter handed out Ralph's valise, and he stepped
down into the darkness, while the train went its way.</p>

<p>"But where the dickens is the other one?" soliloquized
the young man, standing still a moment, the light
snow pelting his face, while he peered into the darkness
for the locomotive's head-light. "It must be behind
that little depot. Here goes for a tour of investigation!"
and with his valise in hand, he strode forward in the
darkness, hardly knowing where he went, and wondering
at the scarcity of railway officials and light.</p>

<p>"The train can't be here. It is probably late," he
thought, and then his foot tripped, and he fell headlong
over a body lying in his path.</p>

<p>A shudder of nameless horror shook the young man
as he scrambled to an erect position, muttering:</p>

<p>"Good heavens! a woman, I know, from the silken
garments. Now, what is she doing out here on the
ground in this Cimmerian darkness, with the snow coming
down in a fury?" He raised his voice and shouted
loudly: "Halloo, halloo!"</p>

<p>The closed door of the depot, with its one blinking
lighted window, opened, and then the form of a man
appeared in the opening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who is it, and what's the matter?" he exclaimed,
shortly.</p>

<p>"Bring a lantern out here. I've found a woman dead
in the snow!" was the startling answer.</p>

<p>Ralph had knelt down and felt the face and hands of
the motionless woman. They were cold as ice, and he
realized that she was dead.</p>

<p>"Horrible!" he murmured, and while he waited for
the man to come with the lantern little thrills of awe
ran through him. The flesh he had touched was firm
and young, the hair was soft and curly, the garments
silken. Who was she, and why was she out here under
the night sky, cold and dead?</p>

<p>The depot agent came hurrying out through the driving
snow, and flashed the light of his lantern full into
their faces, for Ralph was still kneeling down by the
motionless form.</p>

<p>"Who are you, and what is the row?" he inquired,
curiously, but Ralph did not reply.</p>

<p>He was gazing in terror at the silent face with its
closed eyes that lay so pale and still before him, wet with
the falling snow, the bronze curls tangled on the forehead,
drops of blood congealed on the exquisitely-formed
ears; and, oh, horror! the white throat and chin had
dark crimson finger-marks upon them. The small velvet
hat had fallen off, the dress pocket was turned inside
out, one hand had the glove torn off, and was wounded
where a ring had been wrenched from it.</p>

<p>"Oh, Heaven!" groaned Ralph Chainey, in a low voice
of shuddering horror, and the man exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Why, this looks like robbery and murder! See, her
pocket has been turned inside out, a ring has been torn
from her finger&mdash;a diamond, very likely&mdash;and her ears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
are bleeding where her ear-rings have been torn out!
Look at the red marks on her throat! Good Lord; she
has certainly been choked and robbed by some devil in
human shape! Mister, who are you, and where did you
come from, and how did you find her?"</p>

<p>Ralph Chainey, whose face had grown as white as the
dead one before him, did not reply save by a second
groan of unutterable horror. He was wringing his hands
in dismay, and the expression of his eyes was one of bitterest
anguish. Not until the man shook him by the
shoulder, and plied him over and over with questions,
did he reply, telling him in disjointed sentences the simple
truth of how he came there, and adding:</p>

<p>"If I am not mistaken, she is Miss Carew, a young
Boston lady, whom I met there only last night. How
she came here, what is the mystery of this, I can not
understand."</p>

<p class="center">THE FATAL TELEGRAM.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The young village maid, when with flowers she dresses<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Her dark, flowing hair for some festival day,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Will think of thy face till, neglecting her tresses,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">She mournfully turns from the mirror away."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>"Poor thing! she must have been a beauty," the railway
employé said, as he contemplated Kathleen's cold
and beautiful face. "Come, let us carry her into the
house and get a doctor. Maybe she ain't really dead,
only swooned," he continued, hopefully; and between
them they bore her in, and laid her on a bench made
soft with their overcoats.</p>

<p>Then the man ran to his instrument, which was ticking
busily away, and directly said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your train is several hours late, sir; so if you'll stay
here, I'll run and fetch a doctor."</p>

<p>He flashed out at the door, and in the illy-lighted,
shabby little waiting-room Ralph Chainey was alone with
beautiful dead Kathleen, so cruelly murdered.</p>

<p>He knelt down by her side in an agony of dumb despair.
He gazed through blinding tears upon the sweet
white face; he took her cold, white hand and kissed the
wound upon it, and then he whispered, as if she could
hear him:</p>

<p>"Beautiful Kathleen! you will never know now how
dearly I have loved you since first I saw your face! You
are dead&mdash;dead! and soon the dark earth will cover you
away forever from the sight of men. Ah! if only those
dead lips could unclose long enough to tell me the name
of your dastardly murderer, I would pursue him to the
ends of the earth, but that I would bring him to punishment!"</p>

<p>He bent his head until his pale lips touched the rigid
ones of the dead girl. They were icy cold, but the soft
curls of bright hair that lightly brushed his forehead,
how soft, how silken, how alive, they felt! But she was
dead&mdash;this girl who had blushed last night beneath his
glance, whose voice had been so sweet and low when she
spoke to him.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ah, Fate is a cruel lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">A tyrant at best his rule;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And we learn by sin and sword<br /></span>
<span class="i3">While here in his rigid school.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ah, me. I left her with hopes beguiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We parted, and Fate looked on and smiled."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The shock and horror of the occasion began to overcome
him, strong man as he was; and his head reeled;
consciousness forsook him. He fell in a crouching position
upon the floor, where he lay until the doctor entered,
followed by his gentle, girlish wife.</p>

<p>"Oh, the dear, sweet, pretty creature! what an awful
way for her to meet such a fate! The murderer ought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
be burned at the stake!" exclaimed the young wife, sorrowfully,
and her tears fell fast on Kathleen's face.</p>

<p>Doctor Churchman examined the girl's throat carefully,
and said, with a deep sigh:</p>

<p>"Poor thing, she is quite dead! There is nothing I can
do for her but to carry her over to our house and take
care of the body until her friends come."</p>

<p>A deep groan startled him, and Ralph Chainey staggered
dizzily to his feet.</p>

<p>"Ah, sir! so you have recognized this young woman,
Dickson tells me. Well, please dictate a telegraph message
to her friends at once," Doctor Churchman said to
him, gently, for the despairing look on the young man's
face touched him with sympathy.</p>

<p>"He must have been in love with the murdered girl,"
he said to himself.</p>

<p>Ralph went into the little office and sent a message off
to Mrs. Carew's address:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have found Kathleen Carew here dead under very
mysterious circumstances. Please come immediately, as I
am compelled to leave."</p></blockquote>

<p>By one of those strange rulings of fate that so startle
us at times, a mistake was made at the Boston office in
taking the message, and when received by Mrs. Carew
the telegram ran thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have married Kathleen Carew, and nothing can
change it. Please God in Heaven, I am comforted to
know it."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Carew raved with anger, and the very next day
the Boston papers published, as a sensational item, Miss
Carew's elopement and marriage to the handsome actor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
who charmed all women's hearts out of their keeping&mdash;Ralph
Washburn Chainey.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carew's active malice could invent but one sting
for the heart of her step-daughter at so short a notice.
She cabled at once to Vincent Carew in London a garbled
account of Kathleen's elopement with an actor, one
of the lowest and most unprincipled professionals who had
ever disgraced the stage.</p>

<p>Vincent Carew had just been buying his ticket to return
to America. His health was restored, and his heart ached
for a sight of his bonny Kathleen, his beloved daughter.</p>

<p>Close against his heart lay her picture, and her last
sweet, loving letter, in which she implored him to come
home to his unhappy child. She did not mention her
step-mother's unkindness, but a vague suspicion stirred
within him and prompted his speedy return.</p>

<p>His ticket was bought, his luggage, with so many beautiful
gifts for Kathleen stored in it, was sent down to the
steamer. He smiled as he thought of the surprise in store
for his "home folks."</p>

<p>Upon this complacent mood came the malicious cablegram
from his irate wife.</p>

<p>The revulsion from his pleasant mood to keen wrath
was terrible.</p>

<p>Vincent Carew had a dislike to actors in general, of
which no one understood the origin.</p>

<p>The thought of his bonny Kathleen married to one of
this abhorred class drove the proud man beside himself
with shame and rage. For an hour he raged and stormed
about his room until he was on the verge of apoplexy.</p>

<p>Having exhausted the first fury of his anger, he flung
himself into a cab and was driven in haste to a lawyer's
office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>His last act on leaving England was to execute his last
will and testament, in which he angrily disinherited Kathleen,
his only child. Leaving the document with the lawyer
for safe keeping, with instructions to forward it to
America in case of his loss at sea, the angry man was
driven down to the steamer, and embarked for home&mdash;the
home that would be so lonely now without the light of
Kathleen's starry, dark eyes.</p>

<p>Did he repent his harsh and hasty deed, that haughty
man, as he paced the steamer's deck those long moonlight
nights thinking of his dead wife&mdash;lovely, childish Zaidee&mdash;and
the daughter she had left him&mdash;willful, spirited
Kathleen? Did he shudder with fear as he remembered
that should anything happen to him at sea, the cruel will
that disinherited the young girl would be irrevocable? Or
did he gloat over the prospect of her sufferings with her
impecunious husband? No one knew, for in his bitter
trouble and humiliation he stood proudly aloof from all,
cultivating no one's friendship, seemingly absorbed in his
own thoughts, until <i>that</i> night&mdash;that night of awful storm
and darkness&mdash;when fatal disaster overtook the good ship
<i>Urania</i>, and she was burned at sea, her fate sending a
thrill of horror through the heart of the world when
the tidings became known with Vincent Carew's name
among the lost.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>Gentle, womanly hands prepared lovely, hapless Kathleen
for the grave, and she was laid upon a white bier
in Doctor Churchman's pretty parlor. Very pale and
beautiful she looked, and as Ralph Chainey bent over her
for one farewell look, she did not seem like one dead,
but just asleep. It even seemed as though the white
flowers on her breast moved softly, as with a gentle
breath; but when he hastened to hold a mirror over her
lips, it remained clear, without any moisture. He laid it
down with a bitter groan.</p>

<p>His delayed train would arrive in a few moments
and he was compelled to leave the dead girl's side for a
death-bed. He must leave Kathleen here with these kind,
sympathetic people; but he would return as soon as he
could; for there must be an inquest, at which he must be
the chief witness.</p>

<p>He wondered how her relatives would take it&mdash;her
stately step-mother, her pretty step-sister, who had told
him such unblushing falsehoods about Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Helen Fox will be sorry, I know, for she loved Kathleen
dearly," he murmured aloud. Tears fell from his
beautiful brown eyes upon the angelic face, and he went
on talking to the girl in a low monotone, almost forgetting
that she could not hear him, or perhaps fancying that
her gentle spirit hovered near: "My darling, you will
never know how dearly I loved you, nor how I shall
mourn you all my life long! Once I saved your life and
oh! why did not Heaven give me that joy again? Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
did I come too late to-night?" With a groan, he laid his
hand softly on the one that clasped the white flowers on
her breast, and added: "Kathleen, I swear that I will
avenge your murder, if it takes me all my life to do it and
costs me all my fortune!"</p>

<p>He bent and pressed his lips on her white brow and her
soft curls, took a white rosebud from under her pulseless
hand and placed it in his breast, then he was gone. Presently,
when the excited villagers began filing in to look
at the murdered girl, they saw a tear-drop that had fallen
from his eyes glittering like a pearl on the bosom of her
black silk dress.</p>

<p>The little community was wild with horror and excitement
at the finding of the murdered girl in their midst,
and when it became known that she had been recognized
as a great Boston heiress, the <i>furore</i> became even greater.
The telegraph wires flashed the news from town to city,
and the newspapers that one day had chronicled the news
of Kathleen's elopement, printed twenty-four hours afterward
in flaring head-lines the awful story of her robbery
and murder.</p>

<p>Even Mrs. Carew, wicked as she was, paled to the lips
as she read it, and Alpine fainted outright. Weak, selfish,
cruel as the girl was, she had cared for Kathleen more
than she knew. The girl's charms had won upon her, in
spite of herself.</p>

<p>"Good heavens! that actor, he has robbed and murdered
her, the fiend!" Mrs. Carew cried, violently. "He
is even worse than I thought!"</p>

<p>"I do not believe it, mamma. There is some mistake&mdash;there
must be. Ralph Chainey was a gentleman, and
rich in his own right," Alpine answered, speaking the
truth for once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>Like every one else, she admired the young actor, and
though his preference for Kathleen had angered her, she
was not prepared to do him the flagrant injustice of believing
him as wicked as her mother asserted.</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence; then Mrs. Carew exclaimed,
with a startled air:</p>

<p>"Good heavens, Alpine! think what this means to us!
Kathleen dead, the whole Carew fortune is ours!"</p>

<p>Alpine had the grace to be ashamed.</p>

<p>"How can you think of that <i>now</i>?" she exclaimed,
reproachfully. "I&mdash;I had rather know that&mdash;that Kathleen
was alive than have the wealth of the Vanderbilts!"</p>

<p>Then she burst into tears and left the room in a hurry.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carew looked after her aghast.</p>

<p>"I did not think she would take it so hard, but then I
always suspected her at times of a sneaking fondness
for that black-eyed witch," she mused. "Well, I don't
mind. It will look better in society, a little real grief
on Alpine's part. As for me, I'm glad she's out of the
way, and the Carew wealth assured to me and mine."</p>

<p>She gave a low laugh of satisfaction, but her hands
were shaking with excitement, and her heart fluttered
strangely. She was recalling the coincidence of Kathleen's
and her mother's deaths&mdash;both at nearly the same
age&mdash;sixteen&mdash;and both by violent means.</p>

<p>The maid came so suddenly into the room that it gave
her a violent shock. She started and looked around
angrily.</p>

<p>"Why do you enter the room so rudely, without knocking,
Ellen?"</p>

<p>"I beg pardon, madame. I knocked, but you did not
hear, so I made bold to enter, because Miss Belmont sent
me in a hurry."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"She desires to know if I shall get your things ready
to go after Miss Carew's body?"</p>

<p>The woman spoke in an unmoved tone. Her mistress
had taught her to hate the fair young heiress.</p>

<p>"She means to go?" interrogated Mrs. Carew.</p>

<p>"She is getting ready, madame, and told me you were
going."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, Ellen. In the absence of my husband
and son, it is my harrowing duty." Mrs. Carew
put her handkerchief to her dry eyes and sighed: "Make
haste, Ellen."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">ANOTHER MYSTERY.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ah, you or I must look<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Into the other's coffin, far or near,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And read, as in a book,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Words we made bitter here,<br /></span>
<span class="i18">Some time!"<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>There was a little flutter of excitement at Doctor
Churchman's pretty cottage.</p>

<p>The Carews had at last arrived, after being vainly
looked for for more than two days, and their aristocratic
airs and their stylish maid created quite a sensation.</p>

<p>Kathleen was waiting for them in the little parlor&mdash;Kathleen
with shut eyes and pallid lips and folded,
waxen hands&mdash;so unlike the brilliant beauty they remembered,
with this awful calm upon her face.</p>

<p>They gazed upon her, and Mrs. Carew's lips twitched
nervously, while Alpine wept genuine tears, remembering
remorsefully how kind Kathleen had been, and how illy
she had repaid her goodness.</p>

<p>Ralph had not come yet, but a telegram from Richmond
had arrived announcing that he would come early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
in the morning when arrangements had been made to hold
an inquest.</p>

<p>Mrs. Churchman placed rooms at the service of the
ladies and they retired early, pleading fatigue, but really
to talk over all that they had heard.</p>

<p>They had inquired as to the strange telegram that had
been received, and learned the true contents of it. They
knew now that it was of Kathleen's death, not her marriage,
they had been informed.</p>

<p>"She must have arrived here on an earlier train than
Mr. Chainey, so she was evidently running away from
home," said Mrs. Carew, and she added: "I think that
wicked Susette eavesdropped and blabbed my intentions
to her mistress."</p>

<p>"It is very likely," said Alpine, dejectedly. She was
sitting with her pale cheek in her hand, thinking of the
dead girl down-stairs whom she had been taught to hate
and envy. The latter had come easy enough, the former
was a lesson not so easily learned. She wished now, in
her sudden accession of remorse, that she had let herself
love winsome Kathleen, whom it was so hard to hate.</p>

<p>An exquisite casket had been ordered, in which Kathleen
was now resting easily like one asleep. Although
she had been two days dead, there was no sign of change
about her. Beautiful and fair as a flawless pearl lay
Kathleen in her last sleep.</p>

<p>"Immediately after the inquest to-morrow, we will
remove the body to Boston for burial," Mrs. Carew had
said in her haughty manner to Doctor Churchman.</p>

<p>As the night advanced, the whole family retired to rest.
It was not deemed necessary to sit up with the corpse.
She was left alone in the open coffin, the lid being placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
on a table. Not until after the inquest would it be fastened
down on the murdered girl.</p>

<p>Alpine Belmont tossed restlessly upon her couch by
the side of her sleeping mother. She could not rest, this
girl whose conscience had at last awakened. She was
haunted by the ghosts of her evil deeds&mdash;the cruelties she
had shown her little step-sister.</p>

<p>"If she had not run away, she would not have come
to this; but we drove her to it&mdash;it was my mother's sin
and mine," she thought, fearfully, for the crimson marks
on Kathleen's throat, the wounds on her ears and fingers
had thrilled her with horror.</p>

<p>She was not usually romantic, this girl, but Kathleen's
horrible fate had terribly unnerved her. A strange impulse
came to her to go down alone to the parlor, to stand
by that open coffin, and beg Kathleen to forgive her all
the wicked past.</p>

<p>"She will hear me, for the spiritualists tell us that the
souls of the dead remain at first near their unburied
bodies," she thought, superstitiously; and, obeying her
impulse, rose, slipped on a dressing-gown, and drawn by
an awful and irresistible yearning, sought the presence
of the dead.</p>

<p>It was but a few moments more before the whole household
was aroused by piercing shrieks. They rushed to the
parlor and found Alpine screaming beside an <i>empty
coffin</i>!</p>

<p>Kathleen Carew had disappeared as mysteriously as if
her body had followed her soul to Heaven.</p>

<p>The gray light of dawn was stealing in through the
windows, and by that light they saw some withered roses
lying on the floor. Last night they had lain on Kathleen's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
breast. The hall door stood wide open, and a terrible
suspicion came into Doctor Churchman's mind.</p>

<p>The beautiful corpse had been stolen by unscrupulous
parties, either for the purpose of a ransom from rich
relations or for the horrible uses of a medical college.</p>

<p>"I could not sleep, so I came down here to look at her
again, and she was gone," sobbed Alpine, in hysterical
dismay.</p>

<p>Searchers were organized in haste, but no clew was
found, and when Ralph Chainey came it was to be confronted
with this mysterious case. He almost went wild
with agony; he employed the cleverest detectives unavailingly.
Mrs. Carew grew tired of the search, gave it up,
and went back to Boston, congratulating herself in secret
that she would not be at the expense and trouble of a
funeral for her hated step-daughter.</p>

<p>Following fast upon this event came the news of the
<i>Urania's</i> loss at sea, being burned to the water's edge, with

<p>Soon after a cablegram from a London lawyer made
the widow acquainted with the fact of her husband's recent

cordially despised.</p>

<p class="center">A STRANGE FATE.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I never thought that I should see thine eyelids shut in death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy bright brow cold, thy spirit quenched that glowed and bloomed beneath.<br /></span>
<span class="i26"><span class="smcap">Sumner Lincoln Fairfield</span>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Poor Kathleen! she had passed through a strange and
terrible experience.</p>

<p>On that night when she had been so suddenly choked
and robbed by an unseen foe, the young girl had swooned
from terror.</p>

<p>That quick relapse into unconsciousness had saved her
life.</p>

<p>Thinking her dead, the murderer had relaxed his hold
on her throat, and throwing her roughly from him, escaped
with his booty in time to board the other train.</p>

<p>Kathleen, by one of those strange psychological conditions
sometimes induced by severe mental strain or
shock, passed from her swoon into a state of coma or
trance. Through the two nights and one day in which
she lay thus, her senses seemed to be preternaturally
acute, although her bodily faculties were bound in iron
bands of inaction.</p>

<p>What was her agony during the two hours when she
lay alone in the murky darkness and the snow and rain&mdash;what
her joy when the voice of her beloved penetrated
her senses!</p>

<p>Saved, saved! And by <i>him</i>! How she longed to
speak&mdash;to utter aloud her joy and relief; but she could
not voice her gladness&mdash;she could only lie passive and
inert, and hear him proclaim her dead in a voice of the
bitterest despair.</p>

<p>Oh, the blended rapture and agony of those hours!
To lie still like a stone, mute, moveless, and hear <i>his</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
voice breathing his love for her, feel his kisses on her
cold face and hands!</p>

<p>She longed with a terrible yearning to move, to stir
beneath his touch, to cry out to him that she was alive,
that she loved him even as he loved her; but her body
seemed to be as entirely dead as her soul was alive&mdash;alive
and in agony.</p>

<p>She knew that strangers came and went; that they
talked of her as dead; that they spoke of her beauty in
pitying admiration; that they shuddered at the red finger-marks
on her throat, the wounds on her hands and ears
where her jewels had been torn away. She felt tears fall
often on her cold white face; she heard them talk of an
inquest on the morrow, and wonder if her relations
from Boston would soon arrive.</p>

<p>Then came the moment when Ralph Chainey had to
tear himself away from her. She heard gentle Mrs.
Churchman talking to him about her, and saying that she
was not changed in the least&mdash;she was a very natural-looking
corpse.</p>

<p>It seemed to the girl as if her heart leaped wildly
enough to stir the flowers on her breast at that awful
word.</p>

<p>A corpse!</p>

<p>That was what they called her&mdash;when she was so full
of agonized life! Why could they not see that she was
not dead? They said she was unchanged. Why did
they not suspect the truth, that she was in a trance, not
dead?</p>

<p>Then the doctor's wife went out and left Ralph Chainey
alone with the lovely corpse. Then it was he kissed
her brow and hands, and his tears fell on her face. She
heard him utter words of love and of farewell. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
knew that he took a flower from under her hand and went
away, and then she realized that the man she loved better
than any one else in the world had gone away and left
her to her fate. No one else would greatly care if she
were dead or living. Perhaps&mdash;they&mdash;would&mdash;bury&mdash;her&mdash;alive!</p>

<p>At this stage of thought Kathleen seemed to die indeed.
Her acute consciousness of everything became
mercifully suspended; she did not know who came or
went; she did not know when she was placed in the
elegant casket, with its silver plate bearing her name;
she did not know when the two women, her step-mother
and step-sister, came and looked at her in her pallid,
silent beauty. All was a merciful blank.</p>

<p>Then the lamp was turned down to a weak glimmer,
and they left her alone until the morrow. Mrs. Carew
went upstairs to be with her secret, silent exultation,
Alpine with her keen, stinging remorse.</p>

<p>The hours crept on toward midnight, and if any one
had been there to notice, they would have seen a marked
change on the face of the girl in the coffin.</p>

<p>The complexion had lost its deadly pallor and become
more life-like in its hue. The breast was faintly heaving,
the beautiful veil of long, curling black lashes was fluttering
faintly against the cheeks.</p>

<p>Suddenly the black lashes rolled upward; a pair of
large, glorious dark eyes were revealed. In them was
for a moment the blankness of one rousing from a deep
sleep.</p>

<p>Then Kathleen weakly lifted her hands, and as they
dropped at her sides they touched the cold, metallic edges
of the casket. A low, inarticulate cry came from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
lips, and she rose upright, staring about her with bewildered
eyes.</p>

<p>She comprehended that she was about to be buried
alive. Nothing returned to her yet of the past&mdash;everything
merged itself into one startling consciousness of
utter horror, and with a blind instinct of fear struggling
in her dazed mind, Kathleen climbed down out of the
casket, that stood on long trestles, and escaped from the
house.</p>

<p>Doctor Churchman was attending a patient in the neighborhood,
and the front hall door was unlocked. Kathleen
tore it open with a shaking hand and ran out into the
street. A white flood of moonlight shone down upon
the sleeping town, but no one noticed the black clad
figure, bareheaded, with white flowers falling from its
breast, running along with terror-winged feet toward the
open highway, until out of sight of the glimmering white
houses.</p>

<p>Just as Kathleen emerged into the open country, she
saw lights flashing in the gloom, and several men who
seemed to be searching for something or some one. She
shrunk back in alarm, but she was too late. They had
seen her, and came toward her with eager shouts and
made her a prisoner.</p>

<p>"It is she!" exclaimed one. "See, she answers the
description exactly&mdash;young, pretty, dark eyes, light hair,
and a black silk dress!"</p>

<p>"I do not know you. What do you want with me?"
wailed Kathleen, wringing her little white hands piteously.</p>

<p>But they did not answer her. They dragged her away
from the spot and placed her in a waiting carriage. Then
they drove away, and one of them said, significantly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>"She is so exhausted by her long tramp that she will
not be violent, and we shall get her back to the asylum
without any trouble."</p>

<p>Kathleen did not notice what they said. She was so
dazed and frightened by her troubles that her memory
was almost gone. She put her white hands to her brow
and tried to recall her wandering thoughts, to remember
her name, and why she was here. But she could not do it&mdash;everything
was cloudy and vague. With a helpless,
fluttering sigh, she resigned herself to her strange fate,
and crouched shiveringly into the corner of the carriage
that lumbered along the country road a good seven miles
before it came to a standstill before a large, gloomy,
prison-like building.</p>

<p>It was a lunatic asylum, and hapless Kathleen had
rushed upon a strange fate.</p>

<p>A handsome young woman, who had gone mad over
the treachery of a false lover, was being conveyed to the
asylum, and had cunningly eluded her keepers and escaped
into the woods. A reward was offered for her apprehension,
and a large number of men had formed themselves
into searching parties. As none of them had seen
her, and she answered perfectly to the description, one
of these parties had taken Kathleen into custody. At the
asylum it was the same way. No one had seen her, so the
captive was accepted without any doubts as to her identity,
her hatless condition and dazed manners keeping
up the illusion of her insanity. The men received their
reward and went away, never doubting that they had
found the right girl.</p>

<p>Kathleen was put to bed in a small cell by a kind but
illiterate attendant, and, still dazed and dumb with horror,
sunk into a deep sleep. Food had been offered her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
and she had eaten a very little, then pushed it away with
a repellant gesture. After that, she was left alone, and
slept wearily for long hours, awaking refreshed and in
her right mind.</p>

<p>She could remember everything now&mdash;her flight from
home, her journey that had been interrupted by her terrible
experience of robbery and attempted murder. Then
the long trance, her terrified revival in her coffin, and the
frenzied flight into the darkness of the chilly night. All
flashed over her mind in the first, walking moment, and
she wondered why those strange men had captured and
brought her here to this strange place.</p>

<p>"And what a miserable little room and bed; not one
quarter as good as Susette's," she murmured, with a
glance of disdain around her at the tiny cell.</p>

<p>Alas! she soon became aware of the painful fact that
she was an inmate of an asylum for the insane, was believed
to be insane herself, and was called by the name
of Daisy Lynn.</p>

<p>In vain did Kathleen eagerly assure the attendants, and
every one else that would listen to her tale of woe, that
there was a dreadful mistake&mdash;that she was not the girl
they thought her, but Kathleen Carew, of Boston.</p>

<p>They listened to her with significant smiles, and said
to each other:</p>

<p>"In her wanderings she has heard about that poor
murdered girl, and now assumes her identity."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<p class="center">POOR DAISY LYNN.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Do not ask me why I love him!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Love's cause is to love unknown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faithless as the past has proved him,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Once his heart appeared mine own.<br /></span>
<span class="i26"><span class="smcap">Letitia E. Landon</span>.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Spring, summer, and autumn glided past, and still
Kathleen Carew remained an inmate of the asylum. At
first she had been frantic over her strange fate, and her
wild entreaties for freedom had been set down to real
lunacy. The stupid attendant paid no heed to her ravings,
and only laughed when she claimed to be Kathleen Carew,
the beautiful young girl whose murder at Lincoln Station
had so stirred up the whole country.</p>

<p>They were stupid, and did not read the papers, or they
might have seen the strange story of her disappearance&mdash;might
have suspected that she was speaking the truth.</p>

<p>So the weary months went on, and when Kathleen,
after her first wild ravings against her fate, had given
up at last to a sort of sullen despair, something happened
in her favor.</p>

<p>The matron, startled and alarmed by the appearance of
the young girl, felt her heart stirred to pity, and wrote
to her friends:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Miss Lynn is no longer a raving maniac, as at first.
She has become silent and melancholy, and looks so worn
and ill that I fear she is slowly dying of a broken heart.
I think you ought to take her home again, and see what
home associations will do toward prolonging her life.
She will never be troublesome or violent again; the physician
assures me of that. Indeed, the state she has fallen
into is one that often precedes speedy death, and the poor
child ought to have home comforts and petting, now that
she is so very near the end."</p></blockquote>

<p>The matron, who had always pitied and admired the
beautiful, unhappy young girl, watched over her tenderly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
while she waited for the answer to come to this merciful
letter. She was startled at the delicacy of the young girl's
form, that had been so graceful and rounded when she
first came, and the pallor of her face and hands. The
great Oriental dark eyes had become wild and startled,
like those of a haunted fawn, and her voice when she
spoke was low and tremulous, and had the sound of
tears in its music.</p>

<p>When the matron gazed at this sweet and lovely young
girl she marveled that any man's heart could have been
cold and harsh enough to turn against such charms and
leave that young heart to die of despair, or madden with
its cruel wrongs.</p>

<p>"She is beautiful and refined enough for a king's
bride," the matron said, with an angry thought of the
monster in man's likeness who had brought the young girl
to this pass.</p>

<p>She waited eagerly for a letter to come from Miss
Watts, the girl's aunt, hoping and praying that she would
take her away, and not leave her to die at the asylum.</p>

<p>Tears came into her kind old eyes as she thought of
herself robing this beautiful form for the grave, and folding
those waxen white hands on the weary breast for the
last long sleep.</p>

<p>She did not tell Kathleen she had written to her aunt
to take her away, because she feared the effect of a disappointment.
She waited silently, and at last the letter
came. Miss Watts was an old woman&mdash;a soured old
maid, who had not much patience with love and lovers,
and who had been much disgusted with her niece for
losing her senses over a man's perfidy. She was blind,
and her pretty niece had been eyes and hands to her before
her trouble. Now she had to depend on servants entirely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
and she was crosser than ever. She grumbled very much
at the idea of her niece's return.</p>

<p>"A nice place this will be&mdash;me blind and Daisy insane,"
she grumbled; but the thought of the young girl's fading
so fast in the asylum touched her, and she had her maid
to write that the girl might come home if they were
quite, quite sure she was harmless and would not make
any trouble.</p>

<p>So Mrs. Hoover, the kind-hearted matron, came herself
to bring Kathleen home to her aunt, for she wanted to
explain to the old lady the young girl's strange fancy
that she was not Daisy Lynn at all, but Kathleen Carew,
a beautiful young Boston heiress, who had been mysteriously
murdered in the vicinity of the asylum, and of
whom the poor lunatic had chanced to hear in her wanderings.</p>

<p>So Kathleen came into her new home an utter stranger,
but was received as belonging to it. The servants were
new, and the old lady was blind. She could not see the
face of her niece, and she attributed the strange tone of
her voice to her illness. She passed her long, delicate
fingers carefully over Kathleen's face, and exclaimed in
surprise at its delicacy of outline.</p>

<p>Kathleen overwhelmed Mrs. Hoover with kisses and
thanks, and called her her benefactress for securing her
release from the asylum.</p>

<p>"I should have died or gone mad in reality if I had
been kept there much longer; but now I shall go away
from here and find my friends," she said, hopefully.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hoover looked very much alarmed at this declaration.</p>

<p>"My dear, if I had thought you would run away, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
would not have brought you here," she exclaimed, uneasily.</p>

<p>"But, dear madame, I have no claim on this old lady
here, and I must think of my poor father, who has returned
from Europe ere this, I know, and is mourning
me as dead," obstinately answered the pale young girl,
whose heart throbbed wildly at the thought of returning
to her home and friends.</p>

<p>The good old matron seized the wasted little white
hand of the girl, and patted it tenderly in hers, as she said,
remonstratingly:</p>

<p>"Now, listen to me, Daisy, dear: If you run away
from home your aunt will have you followed and brought
back to the asylum, and you know you would not like
that, would you?"</p>

<p>"I would rather die," sobbed the poor girl, trembling
like an aspen leaf.</p>

<p>"Then take my advice, and don't do anything rash,
dear child. Now here's a good idea: Stay quietly here,
and write to your friends to come to you here," said the
matron, who thought that this would pacify Kathleen
a while.</p>

<p>"But I wrote to them from the asylum. I wrote and
wrote and wrote&mdash;all in vain," sighed the girl.</p>

<p>"Perhaps your folks were out of town. I would try
again," soothed the matron, who knew that none of those
pathetic letters had ever gone outside the asylum.</p>

<p>"I will write again," said Kathleen, patiently, for the
matron's hints had sorely frightened her. She did not
want to run away and be captured and taken back to her
terrible prison. She resolved to write again; then, if no
answer came, she must dare her fate. Let her but get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
safely home and all would be explained, and her pursuers
would have to go away baffled.</p>

<p>"How angry papa will be when he finds out what horrors
his little girl has endured," she thought, with burning
tears.</p>

<p>So Mrs. Hoover went away, sadly believing that she
should never see the poor, sweet child again; she looked
so wan and pallid, as if she already had "one foot in the
grave."</p>

<p>Then Kathleen, who was left to herself almost all the
time, went back to poor Daisy Lynn's room, and began
to write to all her friends. By night she had quite a
pile of letters to post.</p>

<p>She had written to her father, to Helen Fox, to Alpine
Belmont, to several of her girl friends, to Ralph
Chainey, and even to Teddy Darrell, who had loved her
and asked her to marry him. Despite his flirting propensities,
Teddy was a prime favorite with every one
because of his warm heart and good nature. If any
one asked Teddy Darrell to do a favor, he would "go
through fire and water" to accomplish it. Helen Fox
was accustomed to say, laughingly, that Teddy Darrell
would try to flirt with a broom-stick if he only saw a
woman's dress on it; but beyond this weakness, which the
girls easily forgave, he was a thoroughly good fellow,
with a good figure, handsome face, and a pair of dark
eyes that always laughed their owner into your good
graces.</p>

<p>"Some of them will get my letters, surely, and come
for me," she thought, as she started out to post her
letters.</p>

<p>Her aunt sent a servant to post them and ordered her
back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>"Reba will always do your errands for you," she said;
and Kathleen had to relinquish them reluctantly to the
maid.</p>

<p>Reba had her instructions, and while Kathleen watched
her from the window, she cleverly pushed some scraps of
papers into the letter-box on the corner, and carried the
letters back to Miss Watts, who locked them into her
private desk.</p>

<p>"It is strange what a fad she has taken into her head!"
she thought, carelessly.</p>

<p>Kathleen waited with burning impatience for the answers
to come to her letters. She counted the hours it
would take for them to go from Philadelphia to Boston.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, almost unconsciously to herself, she began
to take an interest in the absent girl whose place she had
taken in the asylum, and in this small, neat home, so
different from the splendor to which she had always been
accustomed.</p>

<p>The little room she occupied, although not luxurious
and grand like her own in her father's mansion on Commonwealth
Avenue, was a perfect bower of maidenly innocence
and sweet, loving fancies. The windows were
curtained with white lace looped with rosy ribbons; the
brass bedstead had a white lace canopy; the toilet-table,
the lounge, the low chairs, all repeated the pretty fashion
of white lace and rose-pink ribbons, and the floor was covered
with a light-hued carpet strewn with ferns. Pretty
little pictures adorned the mantel and the walls, and the
daintiest kind of a dressing-case was displayed on the
toilet-table. In the drawers were girlish trifles, such as
young girls gather about them, and there was, too, a pretty
little diary, at which Kathleen glanced with tender interest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
wondering what was written on those pages, penned
by the hand of a fair young girl, who had gone mad for
love.</p>

<p>"But it would not be right to read it," she said at first,
and would not touch it, until her loneliness, added to her
interest in poor, missing Daisy Lynn, decided her that
it would be no harm to read the diary.</p>

<p>She opened it, and a man's photograph fell out into her
hands. She gazed at it with eager curiosity, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"This must be the false wretch that drove poor Daisy
Lynn to madness!"</p>

<p>Suddenly the girl's face, already so pale and wan,
whitened to an ashen hue, her great dark eyes dilated in
a sort of horror, and she flung the photograph far from
her into a distant corner, exclaiming, indignantly:</p>

<p>"Ivan Belmont, my step-mother's hateful son, whom
she wanted me to marry, so that I might endow him with
a fortune."</p>

<p>It was some time before she could command her
nerves sufficiently to read Daisy Lynn's diary, and then
her tears fell freely, for the story of the young girl's love
was all written there, gay and joyous at first, then sad
and plaintive, then drifting into deep despair, followed
by the disjointed ravings of a mind distraught.</p>

<p>"Oh, how sweet, and then how sad!" exclaimed Kathleen.
"Love comes to all young girls with the same symptoms,
I suppose, for I felt just as she wrote in the first
after meeting Ralph Chainey&mdash;so gay, so glad, so joyous.
The sky seemed brighter, the flowers sweeter, the whole
world was a new place. There is nothing in the world
as sweet as love."</p>

<p>"Love is sweet, but, oh, how sad it is, too!" she
sighed. "Oh, how cruel it is to love and be beloved

<p>"Poor Daisy Lynn! how could she love Ivan Belmont
like that?" exclaimed Kathleen, in disgust, forgetting
that he <i>was</i> a rather handsome man, and that tastes differ.
A longing to see what Daisy Lynn looked like came
over her, and she searched the room in vain for her picture.</p>

<p>Then she went down and asked Miss Watts if she
might see her niece's photograph.</p>

<p>The old blind lady looked up with gentle displeasure.</p>

<p>"Daisy, child, have you no memory of the past?" she
exclaimed. "You know very well that in all your life I
have never allowed you to have your picture taken!"</p>

<p>"But why not?" asked Kathleen, in wonder.</p>

<p>"Because it is a sin," replied the old lady, who was
rigidly religious. "Have you forgotten," she continued,
"the second commandment that you used to read every
Lord's day at Sabbath-school?" and she repeated, solemnly:</p>

<p>"'Thou shalt not make unto thyself any graven
image, nor the likeness of anything that is in heaven
above, or in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
earth; thou shalt not bow down to them nor worship
them.'"</p>

<p>Kathleen stared in amazement at this liberal interpretation
of the Scriptures, and retired regretting that she
could not have the sad pleasure of gazing on the features
of the unfortunate girl in whose fate her own was so
strangely bound up.</p>

<p>"Poor, poor Daisy Lynn! I wonder what became of
her when she escaped her keeper and wandered abroad
that cold, dark night?" she mused; and she thought that
the girl must be dead and at rest from her sorrows.</p>

<p>A long week of waiting elapsed, but no answer came to
Kathleen's letters.</p>

<p>Kathleen grew desperate with suspense and trouble.
She could no longer while away the dreary winter days
by reading poor Daisy Lynn's novels, or playing sad melodies
on her pretty little piano. She began to pace up and
down the little room for long hours, revolving plans for
escape from Miss Watts.</p>

<p>The three servants whom the old lady employed
guarded the young girl, by the order of their mistress, as
jealously as if she had been a convict in a penitentiary.
All the doors were locked and guarded by burglar chains.
She had appealed to their mercy in vain; and she was
empty-handed and had nothing with which to bribe them.
They had been told she was melancholy mad, and saw no
reason to doubt the story. Her sad, white face, her
beautiful dark eyes, in which the tears so often gathered,
and her mournful little songs, all lent color to the charge.</p>

<p>Desperate emergencies require desperate remedies.
Kathleen decided, in spite of Mrs. Hoover's warnings, to
run away.</p>

<p>She had no money; but that did not deter her from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
her purpose. She would beg in the street for money to
go to Boston before she would remain here any longer,
she told herself, with a burst of tears.</p>

<p>Her old fear of her step-mother had died out in the
conviction that her father had, of course, returned home
ere now, and that, under his protection, no harm could
befall his beloved child.</p>

<p>From the curtained alcove where Daisy Lynn's soft,
white sheets and blankets and counterpanes were stored
on shelves, Kathleen brought the sheets and tore them
into strips, working on them every night until she had
succeeded in making a strong plaited rope with which
to let herself down from the window.</p>

<p>"Heaven help me&mdash;dear Heaven help me!" she prayed
all the while; and one dark night toward midnight she
fastened the rope to the shutter hinge and let herself
safely down to the street.</p>

<p>Stunned by the velocity of her descent, and with
bleeding hands rasped by the rough rope, Kathleen fell
upon the ground and lay there pantingly a few moments.</p>

<p>"Free at last, thank Heaven&mdash;free!" she murmured,
gladly, and wrapping her long circular cloak around her,
and drawing the warm hood close about her beautiful
face, she ran breathlessly along, flashed around a corner,
and had left her prison behind her, fleeing, as she hoped,
to home and happiness.</p>

<p>It was growing late, and in the quiet city of Philadelphia
there were few pedestrians abroad, and those
mostly men. In any other city of that size Kathleen,
with her beautiful face, would have been insulted over
and over, but the Quaker City of Brotherly Love had in
it a smaller ruffianly element than the others. When she
stopped and appealed to those she met she invariably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
received a coin instead of a leer; but they were so small&mdash;so
small, and, oh, it would take so much money to get
to Boston!</p>

<p>She had stopped a policeman on his beat and asked
him timidly how much money it would take to get to
Boston.</p>

<p>"Oh, as much as twenty dollars, I guess!" he replied;
and at his curious stare she thanked him and ran away,
pausing under a street lamp to count her money.</p>

<p>"Only two dollars and twenty cents! I shall never,
never get enough!" she sighed, and then she gave a
shriek. A thief had snatched the money from her little
white hand and run down a side street.</p>

<p>Kathleen started to run after him, but there was no
policeman in sight, and the thief had quite disappeared.
She ran till her limbs trembled with weariness, and suddenly
emerged into Walnut Street. People were coming
out of the Walnut Street Theater, and crowding the
pavement. She saw a handsome man handing a fair
young girl to her carriage, and the sight awoke memories
of the past when she, Kathleen Carew, heiress then to a
million, now a beggar in the streets, had been handed to
her carriage by Ralph Chainey, the handsome young
actor, who had whispered in her ear:</p>

<p>"I hope we shall meet again."</p>

<p>A dry sob rose in her throat, but she choked it back,
and advancing till she was in the midst of the throng,
paused suddenly, and began to sing in a low but thrilling
voice that favorite old song, "Home, Sweet Home," at
the same time holding out her tiny white hand for largess.</p>

<p>It was a desperate deed, but poor Kathleen was a desperate
girl, and knew little more of the evil of the world
than a little baby. She was so eager to get money to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
home, and she thought that out of this great crowd there
might be many who would pay her for singing the simple
little song that everybody loved so well&mdash;"Home,
Sweet Home&mdash;The Song That Reached My Heart."</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<p class="center">"WILL YOU BE MY OWN SWEET WIFE, KATHLEEN?"</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Love thee? So well, so tenderly,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Thou'rt loved, adored by me,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Fame, fortune, wealth, and happiness<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Are worthless without thee!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Kathleen had a sweet and bird-like voice, that had
held crowded drawing-rooms entranced in the happier
days that now seemed so far away.</p>

<p>As that exquisite voice&mdash;timid at first, and faltering,
but gradually gaining strength and volume&mdash;rose upon
the night air the young girl was at once surrounded by a
wondering and admiring throng.</p>

<p>Her desperate courage began to give way as she saw
herself hemmed in by the crowd, and the impulse seized
her to fly; but she beat it bravely back, for already silver
coins began to rain into the small, white, outstretched
hand that seemed so ridiculously dainty and aristocratic
for a street beggar.</p>

<p>"Jove! what a regular beauty!" one man whispered
to another, as he gazed eagerly into the sweet, flower-like
face.</p>

<p>She heard him, and her voice shook with indignation,
but she kept on, holding fast meanwhile to her earnings,
determined that no bold thief should capture them this
time.</p>

<p>Suddenly she became aware that the crowd's attention
was being diverted from her, and resolved to escape at
this auspicious moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>The fact was that the popular actor, Ralph Chainey,
who had just carried staid Philadelphia by storm in his
popular impersonation of Prince Karl, was just leaving
the theater for his hotel, and almost every one turned
away from the beautiful singer for a glimpse of the tall,
dark, handsome young fellow, with his swinging stride,
as he came among them.</p>

<p>He, on his part, had been standing back a little, arrested,
like the others, by that sweet, sad, thrilling song.
As it neared the end, he pressed forward to make a generous
contribution to pay for his share in the rare entertainment.</p>

<p>The crowd fell back and made way for him, and
Kathleen, dreaming not of the nearness of the lover who
haunted all her thoughts, started to fly.</p>

<p>Ralph Chainey had not yet seen her face, but he hurried
in pursuit of the slight cloaked figure, generously
anxious that she should not lose the money he was going
to bestow on her for the song.</p>

<p>The crowd began to disperse, and Kathleen, unconscious
of pursuit, ran half a square, then slackened her
pace. So it was that Ralph Chainey caught up with her,
and laid a strong, detaining hand upon her arm.</p>

<p>With a low moan of terror Kathleen raised her beautiful,
frightened dark eyes to the face of her assailant.</p>

<p>For a moment they gazed, spell-bound, into each other's
eyes.</p>

<p>To both it seemed like the shock of a life-time&mdash;that
sudden <i>rencontre</i>; and to the man it was more startling
then to the girl, for he had long sorrowed over the fate
of Kathleen Carew, believing her dead.</p>

<p>Yet here stood this slight girl whose voice had so
thrilled him a few minutes ago gazing at him with Kathleen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Carew's eyes, looking out of Kathleen Carew's face.</p>

<p>Was she ghost or human?</p>

<p>Was she a phantom of his brain, this slight, pale girl?</p>

<p>He had thought of her so often, he had mourned her
so passionately, that perhaps his brain was distraught&mdash;perhaps
the vision was the figment of a mind diseased.</p>

<p>But suddenly the moan died away on the sweet, red
lips; the hunted look faded from the somber dark eyes
and was succeeded by a look of joy as she faltered:</p>

<p>"Ralph Chainey!"</p>

<p>His hand had slipped from her arm in the first shock
of recognition. Now he hastily put it back and pressed it
to see if it was real flesh and blood or only a phantom
woman. He muttered, hoarsely:</p>

<p>"Kathleen Carew, are you ghost or human?"</p>

<p>Kathleen's dark-eyes laughed radiantly into his.</p>

<p>"I am human, Mr. Chainey, as I think you ought to
realize from the way you're pinching my arm," she returned,
with pretty archness.</p>

<p>All in a moment she had changed from a sad, persecuted
young girl, begging her way in the dark street, to a
very queen of love and happiness.</p>

<p>Looking into his luminous brown eyes, all her sorrow
seemed to flee away, and the sunlit sky of love seemed
glowing over her head, instead of dark, wintery skies.</p>

<p>Her archness, her smiles, and the warm, human touch
of her wrist, recalled him from his ghostly fears, and he
said, faintly, but eagerly:</p>

<p>"I can hardly believe my senses, Kathleen. You&mdash;alive&mdash;after
all these months, when I sorrowed for you
dead! Where have you been?"</p>

<p>Her face paled, and she looked apprehensively over
her shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;can not tell you here!" she faltered. "I might
be missed and followed. If&mdash;if&mdash;you would only take me
to the depot, and send me home to Boston to papa, I will
be so grateful. I&mdash;I&mdash;think I have enough money to pay
my way."</p>

<p>Ralph Chainey signaled a passing cab, and lifted the
young girl gently into it.</p>

<p>"Drive slowly about the streets for an hour until
further orders," he said to the driver, as he sprung in and
took his seat by Kathleen. "Oh, what happiness this is
to find you alive, Kathleen!" he exclaimed, searching for
her little hand, and holding it warmly clasped in his.</p>

<p>She nestled slightly toward him, and he thrilled with
happiness at the confiding motion.</p>

<p>"You will send me home to papa?" she repeated,
sweetly.</p>

<p>Then he said:</p>

<p>"It will be several hours before the next train for Boston
leaves, Kathleen, so you can tell me all about yourself
while we ride about and beguile the time of waiting.
Or, would you prefer to go to a hotel and rest, and have
some refreshments?"</p>

<p>"I am not hungry nor tired, and prefer to ride about
with you this way," answered the girl, with naïve simplicity;
and he drew a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>He was young, but more worldly wise than Kathleen.
He preferred not to take her to a hotel until she had some
claim on him, to silence carping tongues. But first he
must know the secret of her mysterious whereabouts ever
since the night when he had kissed and wept over her
beautiful dead face, and gone away on a mission that
brooked no delay.</p>

<p>But for a few minutes he was silent from sheer happiness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Alive, his beautiful Kathleen, whom he had adored
in secret, but never told of his love! What happiness,
when he and happiness had so long been strangers!</p>

<p>Her tremulous voice broke the silence:</p>

<p>"Do you understand it all&mdash;that I was in a trance that
night when you bade me farewell and went away?"</p>

<p>"My God! a trance? Yes, you <i>did</i> look natural. Mrs.
Churchman remarked upon it before she left me alone
with you."</p>

<p>"I heard what she said," Kathleen answered, shuddering,
and Ralph Chainey put his arm about her and
drew her closer, murmuring:</p>

<p>"Did you hear what I said, too, my bonnie Kathleen?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, trembling in a sort of ecstasy
and feeling warm blushes redden her cheeks as she
whispered:</p>

<p>"You kissed me&mdash;you wept over me&mdash;you&mdash;said&mdash;said&mdash;that
you loved me!"</p>

<p>"And you, sweet Kathleen? Were you vexed at me
for my presumption?" questioned the young man, drawing
her closer with a fond but reverent arm.</p>

<p>"No; oh, no!" faltered the girl, shyly, yet blissfully.</p>

<p>"And you will let me tell you the same thing over,
darling Kathleen, that I worship you, and you will promise
me, dear, to be my own sweet wife? Yes, is it not,
my own one? There, do not draw away from me in fear.
One kiss, my own love, my beautiful treasure, given
back to me from the grave itself!"</p>

<p>Then one kiss became a dozen. He pressed her close
to his heart, and she rested there with a blissful sigh,
happy in this haven of rest.</p>

<p>Presently:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, darling, you may tell me all your story; then
I have a startling proposition to make to you," he said.</p>

<p>From what she had said to him about taking her home
to her father, he perceived that she was entirely ignorant
of all that had transpired since her supposed death.</p>

<p>She was mercifully ignorant of her father's loss at sea,
and the will made in London just before he sailed, disinheriting
his only daughter, and giving her portion of his
wealth to Alpine Belmont.</p>

<p>Poor little Kathleen, who believed that she had still
a loving father and was the heiress to all his wealth, was
in reality orphaned and penniless&mdash;a beggar in reality.</p>

<p>But Ralph Chainey, in the greatness of his noble heart,
decided to spare her the pain of knowing all this yet, and
he could see but one way out of the difficulty&mdash;one very
agreeable to himself, and not unkind to the lovely waif
so strangely thrown on his protecting care.</p>

<p>He knew well that the selfish Belmonts would refuse
to care for the homeless girl, would deny her identity,
refuse to admit her claims on them. He determined to
propose an immediate marriage to Kathleen, by which
her future could be made secure.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">KATHLEEN'S DISAPPEARANCE.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ay, call her on the barren moor,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And call her on the hill;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">'Tis nothing but the heron's cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And plover's answer shrill."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Kathleen told her lover, between sobs and tears, while
she rested close in the shelter of his loving arms, all her
sad story.</p>

<p>Ralph Chainey listened with bated breath, his eyes dim
with moisture, to the story of Kathleen's persecutions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"What stupid people they must have been at the asylum
not to listen to your strange story! I will have them
indicted for unlawfully detaining you!" he exclaimed
indignantly.</p>

<p>"Never mind that, as they can never find me again,"
she replied, happily.</p>

<p>"They could not take you if they did," he answered;
and then he unfolded to her, gently and tenderly, his wish
to make her his wife at once, and asked her if she would
consent. "It is the most proper thing for us to marry
at once," he said. "Unfortunately, we can not be married
in Philadelphia without a license, which, as it is
near midnight now, I could not procure until to-morrow.
But we can take a train within the hour for Washington,
and be married, without the necessity of a license, by the
first minister we can wake up there. Do you think you
can agree to this, darling?"</p>

<p>She hesitated; she said, anxiously:</p>

<p>"Had we not better go straight to Boston and ask
papa's leave? Perhaps he would not like it if we were
married without his consent."</p>

<p>Why did he not tell her the truth&mdash;that there was no
use in going to Boston; that her father was dead and she
had no home there; that her step-mother and her selfish
daughter had inherited the Carew millions?</p>

<p>He could not bear to inflict this shock upon her so soon.
She had suffered so much already, poor little darling!
that he would save her this added blow for a little while.
He could fancy how hard she would take it, to come back
to the world, fatherless, penniless, homeless. Let him
make her his wife first, and she would have love, wealth,
and position almost equal to what she had lost. Then
he would have the right to comfort her with his devotion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>So he began to urge his suit with all a lover's devotion,
picturing to her the possibility of her father's refusal.</p>

<p>"You are so young, dear Kathleen, he might want us
to wait years and years, and there are so many things that
might come between our love," he urged, anxiously.</p>

<p>She shuddered and thought of Alpine Belmont's cruelty.
The remembrance decided her; she consented to his wish.</p>

<p>They were driven to the station to take the train for
Washington.</p>

<p>"In about three hours we shall be there, and then you
shall soon be my little wife," he whispered, joyfully.</p>

<p>They learned that the train was more than an hour late.
They went into the reception-room to wait.</p>

<p>Then it suddenly occurred to him that the members of
his company at the hotel would be so alarmed at his non-appearance
that night that they would think he had been
foully dealt with, and raise a great hue and cry.</p>

<p>He hastened to explain these facts to his lovely, girlish
<i>fiancée</i>.</p>

<p>"Do you think you would mind staying alone here,
long enough for me to go and excuse myself to them?"
he inquired, tenderly.</p>

<p>Her throat ached with the impulse to sob out to him
that she was frightened&mdash;that she did not wish for him
to leave her there alone.</p>

<p>But she was ashamed of her weakness; she would not
confess it to her bright, handsome lover.</p>

<p>In a low, tremulous voice, and with a sad little smile
on her quivering red lips, she bade him go.</p>

<p>"It is only for a little while, my own little love!" he
whispered; but her heart sunk heavily with fear and
dread. He found her a secluded seat in a dim corner.
"You can sit here quietly and unobserved until I return,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
he said, and stole a parting kiss from the sweet red lips
that smiled at him with such pathetic love.</p>

<p>Then he was gone, and she no longer tried to check
her bursting sobs. Leaning far back in the corner, her
little cobwebby handkerchief was soon drenched with
her raining tears.</p>

<p>She told herself that he would soon return and laugh
at her for being such a great baby, but she could not help
it. A terrible presentiment of coming evil weighed down
her spirits.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ralph Chainey entered a cab and was driven rapidly to
his hotel. He explained that business of great importance
called him in haste to Washington, but that he would
return the next day in time for the evening performance,
"Beau Brummel."</p>

<p>Then he drove as fast as possible back to the depot,
where his little darling, as he called her in his fond
thoughts, was impatiently awaiting his return.</p>

<p>"My little darling, so soon to be my adored wife," he
murmured, as he hurried eagerly into the waiting-room,
where the second great shock of his life awaited him.</p>

<p>Kathleen Carew was gone!</p>

<p>He stared with dazed eyes at the empty seat where he
had left his beautiful young sweetheart less than an hour
ago.</p>

<p>She was gone!</p>

<p>Then commenced a frantic search that lasted so long
that by and by the train that was to have taken the pair
to Washington thundered into the station and away again,
while he still pursued his unavailing quest.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>

<p class="center">"RALPH CHAINEY IS A MARRIED MAN!"</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">One foot on sea and one on shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">To one thing constant never."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>When Ralph Chainey had led Kathleen into the waiting-room
of the depot he had been so absorbed in her that
he failed to notice any one around him.</p>

<p>So he did not observe a pretty and showily-dressed
blonde beauty who was walking restlessly up and down
the room, evidently bent on attracting attention to herself
and her dress by these maneuvers.</p>

<p>When Ralph entered with Kathleen, the young woman
gave him a curious glance that speedily changed to one
of dismay.</p>

<p>Then she shrunk back hurriedly into the shadow and
watched the pair with bright, steel-blue eyes that glittered
with the light of hate.</p>

<p>"A love affair," she muttered, angrily, and noted
keenly every movement of the two. She saw how they
looked at each other with the light of love in their beautiful
eyes. She stole nearer and overheard their words;
she saw their kiss, their tender parting.</p>

<p>Her white hands clinched themselves tightly, her face
paled beneath its rouge, and she muttered indistinctly
to herself&mdash;muttered words of hate and menace.</p>

<p>When Ralph Chainey had left Kathleen alone the
stranger boldly approached the weeping girl.</p>

<p>Standing before Kathleen, she touched her on the shoulder,
and when Kathleen shrunk back and lifted her white
face in piteous fear and entreaty, the stranger almost
started at its wonderful beauty.</p>

<p>"Ralph Chainey is deceiving you," was the startling
sentence that fell on Kathleen's ear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!" the girl exclaimed in bewilderment; but the
blonde beauty went on:</p>

<p>"He has promised to marry you, but he does not mean
it, you poor, pretty child. It is only a plot to betray
you."</p>

<p>"You speak falsely," Kathleen managed to stammer
in a choking voice, her dark eyes flashing indignantly.</p>

<p>"You do not want to believe it, I know, but I can prove
to you that I speak the truth. Ralph Chainey is a married
man. <i>I am his wife!</i>"</p>

<p>Kathleen grew as pale as she had been in her coffin that
terrible night; her dark eyes stared as if fascinated into
the pretty painted face of the woman. She could not
speak; her head seemed to be going round and round; her
poor heart throbbed as if it would break.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you have heard that actors are wicked people,"
continued the pretty stranger. "It is true of the
whole class, and most especially of this Ralph Chainey.
He is always seeking for a new love, and leaving some
other woman to break her heart for love of him. Although
I am his wife, he tired of me months ago, and left
me to starve or die of a broken heart, he cared not
which, so that he was well rid of me. My kind parents
took me home, and since then I have watched his career in
amazement and despair. Many and many a fair and innocent
young girl I have saved from his clutches."</p>

<p>"Oh, Heaven! must I believe this?" came in a low,
sobbing under-tone from Kathleen's pale lips.</p>

<p>"You are the youngest and fairest of them all and it
would break my heart to see you fall into Ralph Chainey's
power," continued the blonde, anxiously. "Be warned
in time, my poor girl. Fly from this spot and go home
to your friends."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have no friends in this city, and my home is in far-off
Boston," sobbed Kathleen, clasping her little hands in
despair.</p>

<p>"Then come home with me, and stay all night, and you
can go on to Boston to-morrow morning early," was the
quick reply.</p>

<p>She waited for an answer, but none came. Kathleen's
head had drooped on her breast. A fatal unconsciousness
had stolen over her, and the hour of her enemy's triumph
was at hand.</p>

<p>The blonde beauty laughed low and maliciously, as she
realized how deeply her words had struck their poisoned
arrows into the young girl's heart.</p>

<p>Coolly signaling a stranger who had hurriedly entered
the almost deserted waiting-room, she said:</p>

<p>"My friend has fainted from grief at receiving a telegram
containing news of the death of her lover. Will
you assist me to carry her out to my carriage before she
revives? I know she will go into hysterics as soon as she
recovers, and that would be so embarrassing in this public
place."</p>

<p>The gentleman, a slight-built, genial-faced man of about
thirty years, courteously acceded to her request, and gazed
with deep compassion at the beautiful face of the unconscious
girl he was carrying in his arms.</p>

<p>"What a lovely creature! and so young&mdash;scarcely
more than a child; yet she had a lover, and he is dead,"
he thought, pityingly, as he placed her in the carriage.</p>

<p>"I thank you for your kindness," said the blonde
beauty, with a dazzling smile. The carriage door closed
upon her after she had said "Home" to the driver, and
then Samuel Hall, the kind-hearted, smiling-faced young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
man, stood under the gas-light, gazing after them with
dazed blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Quite an adventure, Sammy, was it not, eh?" he muttered,
talking naïvely to himself. Perhaps his arms
thrilled yet with the pressure of the beautiful form that
had lain heavily in them a minute ago. His mild blue
eyes looked soft and dreamy.</p>

<p>"How lovely she was!" he mused. "So lovely and so
sorrow-stricken! The other one was handsome, too, in
her way, but not like the younger. Grand, rich people, I
suppose," he ended with a sigh; for, having once known
"better days," our friend "Sammy" did not very much
enjoy his position as a hard-working clerk in one of Philadelphia's
immense dry-goods emporiums.</p>

<p>He went home to his lonely room in a great, rambling
boarding-house, and though he was not usually impressionable,
his mind kept running on his little adventure.
He said to himself that it was because he was so sorry
for the beautiful young girl who had fainted when she
received the telegram that her lover was dead.</p>

<p>"I wonder what their names were?" he mused, curiously.
"The blonde I did not quite like. There was
something theatrical and made-up about her. She did not
in the least resemble the fainting one, so they could not be
sisters."</p>

<p>Still musing on his little adventure, he retired. Sleep
came to him, made restless by uncanny dreams.</p>

<p>It seemed to the young man that he was standing on
the verge of a precipice, looking down into a dark gulf
where a turbulent river rushed along in foam and fury.
Struggling in the gloomy waves was the young girl he
had carried fainting to her carriage, and her white face
was upturned to him; her great, piteous dark eyes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
fixed on his with unutterable reproach. Tossing her white
arms up toward him, she cried, bitterly:</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> helped that wicked woman to destroy me!"</p>

<p>Then she sunk beneath the waves, and they closed forever
over her white face and shining hair.</p>

<p>Sammy Hall awoke in anguish, his forehead beaded
with perspiration.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a strange, weird dream! How vivid it is
still in my mind! What does it mean? Is it a warning?
That can not be, however, for I was doing her a kindness,
not an injury, and my heart ached with sympathy
for her sorrow."</p>

<p>He could think of nothing else next day, and at noon,
when a heavy storm came up and kept customers from
crowding into Haines &amp; Co.'s great store, he told the
bright, pretty young salesladies about it, dream and all.</p>

<p>They listened to him with the liveliest interest; their
eyes grew dim with pity for the beautiful young girl whose
heart had broken for the death of her lover.</p>

<p>"But it was so strange for her to reproach me in that
dream!" he said, in a troubled voice&mdash;"so strange! Because,
you see, I was only kind to her, and did nothing
wrong."</p>

<p>"Mr. Hall, I have a theory to explain your dream,"
cried Tessie Mays, a romantic young girl; and every one
turned to her with interest as she went on: "The blonde
was a bad, wicked creature who frightened that pretty,
innocent young thing into a faint, and then carried her
off to some wretched fate&mdash;'the spider and the fly,' you
know."</p>

<p>"It is very likely, indeed!" chorused all those romantic
young girls, and Sammy Hall's heart sunk like a stone
in his breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>He brooded over that night's adventure, and in his sleep
that strange dream kept recurring. He feared that Tessie
Mays was right. The blonde woman was a wicked creature
who had made him a tool to help her in her nefarious
plans.</p>

<p>Two days later, as he was going along Ninth Street to
dinner, he came suddenly face to face with the blonde,
made up carefully and gaudily attired. He stopped in
front of her and stammered:</p>

<p>"Oh! ah! miss&mdash;madame&mdash;excuse me; but how is that
unhappy young girl?"</p>

don't know what you mean. Get out of my way!"</p>

<p>She pushed him roughly aside, and had disappeared before
he recovered from his surprise.</p>

</div></div>


<p>When Kathleen Carew recovered consciousness she
found herself on a bed in a shabby garret bed-room, with
the eyes of the blonde beauty looking into hers.</p>

<p>"So you are come to at last? I began to think you
were dead, child. Here! smell this, and you'll soon be better,"
she exclaimed, vivaciously, as she held a bottle of
camphor under Kathleen's nose.</p>

<p>Kathleen pushed it away like a petulant child.</p>

<p>"What am I doing here?" she sobbed, in a frightened
voice.</p>

<p>"This is my home, you know. I offered to bring you
here to save you from Ralph Chainey, that wicked actor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
Oh, my! what a scene there was after you fainted. He
came back, and I can tell you, he was frightened at finding
<i>me</i> there. I told him he must go away, that I had
told you all, and you hated him. He tried to brazen it all
out at first, but presently he was humble enough, and I
made him carry you out and put you in my carriage.
Then he went away, vowing he would get you into his
power some day."</p>

<p>Kathleen shuddered from head to foot, and cried, appealingly:</p>

<p>"Oh, madame, is he really your husband? For the
sake of Heaven, do not tell me an untruth, for it is more
bitter than death to lose faith in one's lover!"</p>

<p>"Alas! if it is so hard to lose faith in a lover, how
much worse to be deceived by a husband?" cried the
blonde, pathetically.</p>

<p>She dashed her white hand across her dry eyes, and
Kathleen caught the glitter of a diamond ring flashing
like a little sun. In her small, pink ears there were magnificent
diamonds, too, and Kathleen began to watch them
with fascinated eyes.</p>

<p>"What a beautiful diamond ring! Won't you let me
try it on, please?" she asked, humbly.</p>

<p>The blonde, flattered by the admiration for her ring,
slipped it off with some difficulty, and allowed Kathleen
to take it in her fingers.</p>

<p>She held it up and gazed inside the gold circle, reading
aloud:</p>

<p>"'Kathleen Carew!'"</p>

<p>"Why, I never knew before that a name was cut&mdash;&mdash;"
began the woman, then bit her lip and checked herself,
abruptly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where did you get this ring?" asked Kathleen, excitedly.</p>

<p>"My husband gave it to me."</p>

<p>"And your beautiful ear-rings?"</p>

<p>"They, too, were gifts from my husband."</p>

<p>"From Ralph Chainey?"</p>

<p>"Of course. Didn't I tell you he was my husband?
Do you want to see my marriage certificate?" holding out
her finger for the ring.</p>

<p>"Presently," said Kathleen, sitting erect, with a strange
fire in her eyes. "Is this," she continued, in a strange
voice, "<i>your</i> name inside the ring?"</p>

<p>"Of course," airily answered the blonde.</p>

<p>Kathleen's slumbrous eyes began to glow with an
angry light, and she exclaimed, passionately:</p>

<p>"It is false! It is my own name, and the ring is
mine! The ear-rings also are mine! My father gave
them to me!"</p>

<p>"You must be crazy, girl!" exclaimed the blonde, in
honest surprise. She snatched the ring and slipped it
back on her finger.</p>

<p>"I tell you I am in earnest," stormed Kathleen, roused
to a sudden fury by the thought of her wrongs. "I tell
you I am Kathleen Carew, and those jewels were stolen
from me by a man who choked me and left me for dead
on the ground, while he tore those gems from my bleeding
hands and ears. And you say it was your husband&mdash;&mdash;"
she stopped, shuddering violently. Was she
criminating Ralph Chainey?</p>

</div></div>


<p>Kathleen, pale, shuddering, startled, gazed in horror
at the face of the bold, handsome creature who declared
to her that these gems for which she had been almost
murdered were given to her by Ralph Chainey.</p>

<p>Was it true that the woman was Ralph's wife, and that
he had given her the jewels?</p>

<p>If so, what an awful vista of suspicion and crime
opened back of these two facts!</p>

<p>Could it be that Ralph Chainey was the fiend who had
robbed and murdered her that night, and then by his
clever acting thrown off suspicion from himself?</p>

<p>The terrible suspicion made her tremble like a leaf in
the wind; and meantime the woman, whom we will call
Fedora, was gazing at her with suspicious eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to make of you, girl," she said, impatiently.
"Come, now; I want to hear your story from
beginning to end."</p>

<p>Kathleen did as she was asked. She related the whole
story of her life, from the first meeting with Ralph
Chainey until now.</p>

<p>Fedora listened with eager attention.</p>

<p>She was especially interested in Mrs. Belmont and her
son Ivan.</p>

<p>"And she wanted you to marry <i>him</i>?" she said.</p>

<p>"Yes; but I will never do it. I hate him, and so does
papa. He is a spendthrift, and dissolute," said Kathleen,
quoting words that her father had used of his step-son.</p>

<p>Fedora frowned and said, hastily:</p>

<p>"But he is very handsome, isn't he?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe some people think so, but I don't. I guess
Daisy Lynn thought so, or she would not have gone mad
for love of him;" and the whole story of Daisy Lynn
came out.</p>

<p>It proved very interesting indeed to the blonde, who
asked many questions, and seemed disappointed that
Kathleen could not answer them all.</p>

<p>When she had elicited all that Kathleen could tell, she
returned to the subject of Ralph Chainey.</p>

<p>"I knew he was false to me, but I did not believe he
was wicked enough to do murder," she said.</p>

<p>Kathleen shuddered as with a mortal chill, and said
faintly:</p>

<p>"There must be some mistake."</p>

<p>The blonde gazed in silence for several minutes at the
lovely face of the hapless young girl, then asked, abruptly:</p>

<p>"What shall you do about it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," Kathleen answered, sorrowfully; and she
thought to herself that she would give the world to blot
out of her life all memory of the man she had loved so
dearly and so well; yet she knew that his memory would
haunt her all her life long, and that her heart would break
because he had proved unworthy.</p>

<p>She looked pleadingly at the woman before her, and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Will you please take me home to my father?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow," answered Fedora, soothingly. She rose
as she spoke. "Lie down and sleep; it is late," she added.
"To-morrow I will go home with you and restore you to
your friends."</p>

<p>She went out, carefully locking the door behind her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>Alone in her own room, she looked at the beautiful
jewels that had cost Kathleen so dear, and muttered:</p>

<p>"He did it for me&mdash;to get these for me. How he loves
me! But this girl! her life is a menace to his liberty. If
I let her go home and tell what she knows, suspicion will
fall upon <i>him</i>. Why did he bungle so, if he must do that
ghastly job?" Then she laughed. "Oh, I have paid <i>you</i>
out, Ralph Chainey!"</p>

</div></div>


<p>Sammy Hall was bitterly sorry that he had missed
getting any information from the blonde about the beautiful
girl he had seen with her that night at the station.</p>

<p>The beautiful white face and closed eyes of the young
girl haunted him with strange persistency.</p>

<p>And after his accidental <i>rencontre</i> on the street with
the insolent blonde he felt more apprehensive than ever.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew where she lived: I would find out
more about her," he thought; and fell to watching for
the bright, steel-blue eyes and golden hair every day.</p>

<p>He was rewarded for his efforts when one day he saw
her at the trimming counter buying some gold passementerie
from Tessie Mays.</p>

<p>Sammy Hall waited till she had sailed out of the store,
then went across to the young salesgirl.</p>

<p>"It's that woman&mdash;the one that carried off the girl
that night. I saw her give you her address. What is
it?" he queried, excitedly.</p>

<p>As much excited as himself, Tessie gave it to him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
he began to set his wits to work to find out the mystery
of that night.</p>

<p>To Kathleen's indignation and dismay, Fedora had
kept her a close prisoner in the shabby little garret chamber
ever since that night&mdash;now five days ago&mdash;when she
had been brought there.</p>

<p>To quiet the complaints of the girl, Fedora told her
that she dare not let her go outside the house, because
her aunt's emissaries were searching for her everywhere,
and that, if found, she would be arrested and taken back
to the asylum.</p>

<p>"You must remain quietly hidden here until the search
blows over," she said; and no entreaties could move her
jailer's heart; there was always a plausible excuse; but
Kathleen, looking into the flippant, insolent face, began
to distrust the woman.</p>

<p>"She hates me&mdash;hates me because Ralph Chainey said
he loved me," she thought, uneasily; and she grew frightened
in the miserable little garret room in which she was
kept a prisoner, seeing no one but Fedora, who brought
her food with her own hands&mdash;food which tasted palatable
enough, but which seemed only to sap the young girl's
strength.</p>

<p>For with each day Kathleen grew weaker and weaker.</p>

<p>At first she had been wont to pace the chamber restlessly
for hours. Now her limbs grew weary; her brain
seemed to reel. She rested in the chair, then upon the
bed, and her burning brain was full of the thought of
Ralph Chainey's treachery.</p>

<p>"I loved him so, I loved him so&mdash;yet he was wicked,
false and cruel beyond all men!" she sobbed; and the
knowledge was killing to her. She thought that now, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
last, she was going mad, like poor Daisy Lynn, over a
lover's falsity.</p>

<p>She did not know that it was death, not madness, that
was approaching; but the food brought her by Fedora
was drugged, so that in a short time it must cause her
death if she kept on taking it.</p>

<p>She did not dream what a terrible interest the woman
had in her death, and that she had decided that Kathleen
Carew must never go out of that house alive.</p>

<p>"He did it for <i>me</i>, and I must not let her go free,"
she decided, grimly, and went unfalteringly about her
plans for ending that sweet, innocent young life.</p>

<p>Kathleen found her imprisonment here more galling
than it had been in the home of Miss Watts. There was
here no pretty, dainty room filled with a young girl's
dainty books and pictures, but only squalor such as might
have surrounded an uneducated servant.</p>

<p>She wondered much over the house she was in, and if
her jailer, the gaudily attired blonde beauty, inhabited
such a shabby apartment as she allotted to her guests.
But she was not likely to have her curiosity gratified on
this point, as Fedora always locked the door on leaving,
and there was only one window&mdash;a small one, very high
up&mdash;that gave an uninteresting outlook on the walls of
other houses&mdash;poor ones, it seemed, from their moldy
bricks.</p>

<p>A day came when Fedora did not bring her any dinner,
and the whole day wore away dully and gloomily. It was
the day when Samuel Hall saw her shopping in the store
of Granville B. Haines &amp; Co. Kathleen did not dream
of what had happened, but Fedora had moved out of the
house that day, leaving her victim to her fate.</p>

<p>Kathleen ate so little of the drugged food prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
for her that she had lived longer than the woman anticipated,
so she decided to leave her to starve to death in
the unoccupied house, where she was locked into the
wretched garret.</p>

<p>When she gave her address to the pretty saleslady at
Granville B. Haines &amp; Co.'s, it was in a fit of absent-mindedness
that saved Kathleen's life.</p>

<p>Instead of giving her new address, she gave her old
one, and, as we have seen, Samuel Hall at once secured
it from Tessie Mays.</p>

<p>So excited was the young man, and so fearful that
harm had befallen the beautiful young girl of that night's
adventure, that he actually secured the services of a policeman,
and finding the house closed and seemingly
unoccupied, the doors were broken open and a strict
search instituted.</p>

<p>When they had almost begun to despair of success,
the beautiful victim was found by the delighted young
clerk, who at once recognized her as the fainting girl he
had placed in the carriage that night.</p>

<p>She fainted again when she learned that she was saved,
and the policeman and Sammy had some difficulty in restoring
her to consciousness. When they had done so,
they were filled with grief and horror at the story she
had to tell.</p>

<p>"Oh, let me go to papa!" she begged them, pathetically,
and Samuel Hall, melted by her beauty and distress,
assured her that she should be sent at once to Boston.
A closed carriage was secured, and Sammy and the
sympathetic policeman escorted her to the station, where
a first-class ticket was bought and Kathleen placed in a
Pullman car.</p>

<p>"God forever bless you!" sobbed the young girl, weeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
over Sammy's hand, and overwhelming him with
promises of what her rich father would do to reward him
for his nobility.</p>

<p>Then the train steamed away out of the station, and
there were tears in the eyes of both men, through which
they saw dimly the pale and lovely face, on which a little
hopeful smile was budding into bloom.</p>

<p>The policeman made Sammy promise to keep a sharp
lookout for the perfidious blonde, and to let him know
if he found her, so that she might be arrested and punished
for kidnapping the girl. Then the two separated,
the policeman returning to his regular beat, and Sammy
to the store, where he told the sympathetic young girls
the story of his knightly deliverance of Kathleen, and
became quite a hero in their admiring eyes.</p>

<p>But gladdest of all was our beautiful Kathleen, speeding
as fast as steam could carry her back to Boston and
to papa, who must surely have come home ere now, and
who would be so glad to see his little girl.</p>

<p>It snowed in Boston that night when Ivan Belmont
came home on his usual mission&mdash;to extort money by
begging, coaxing, threats or curses&mdash;(he usually tried all
in succession before he succeeded)&mdash;from the rich widow,
his mother, and the heiress, his sister.</p>

<p>And he was wont to say on these occasions that he
would almost rather <i>work</i> for the money than to extort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
it from those two penurious women, they were so close-fisted
and quarrelsome.</p>

<p>It was quite true what he said. Money he <i>would</i> have,
but he was so spendthrift and reckless that his mother
groaned in spirit over his excesses, and often flatly refused
him a penny.</p>

<p>Then he would have recourse to Alpine, and he never
left until he secured it, although he invariably had to
raise a storm before he succeeded.</p>

<p>His periodical pirating visits grew to be deplored by the
whole household, even by the servants, who knew that the
effects of his demands were to be dreaded for days, in
the increased harshness and ill-temper of the two women
they served.</p>

<p>To-night the contest had raged hotter than ever before
and only the threat of criminal deeds, unless his demands
were met, had sufficed to draw gold from the pockets of
his relatives.</p>

<p>Chuckling over his success, he left the house and prepared
to face the raging storm outside on his way back
to the distant city whence he had come.</p>

<p>Crushing his hat down over his face, he hurried down
the marble steps, pausing at the bottom in surprise at seeing
the cloaked figure of a female in the act of ascending
the steps.</p>

<p>The glare of a street-lamp shone full on the scene.
Curiosity prompted him to stare at the beautiful white
face upraised timidly to his own.</p>

<p>As he did so, his own face whitened with horror, his
eyes dilated, his limbs trembled with fear.</p>

<p>"My God!" he muttered, hoarsely; and turning, fled
from the spot in mad haste, like one pursued by fiends.</p>

<p>He believed that he had seen a veritable ghost, for it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
was the pale, lovely face of Kathleen Carew into which
he had gazed so wildly&mdash;Kathleen, whom he believed
dead. So he fled from the spot as wildly as his trembling
limbs would permit.</p>

<p>Kathleen had always disliked and despised Ivan Belmont,
so she only smiled scornfully at his precipitate
flight, and began to ascend the marble steps, her heart
beating with joy at the thought of meeting her father
again.</p>

<p>"I wonder if James will be frightened, too, and run
away, thinking me a ghost?" she murmured, with a sad
little smile, as she rang the bell.</p>

<p>But it was not James who opened the door to her; it
was a total stranger, who stared in surprise at the sight
of a beautiful, refined-looking young girl out alone on
such a stormy night.</p>

<p>All the old servants had been discharged after Kathleen's
death, because they had irritated Mrs. Carew by
grieving after their young mistress.</p>

<p>So the man looked in wonder at the strange young
girl with the rich golden hair and flashing dark eyes who
stepped across the threshold as if she belonged there, and
said to him with gentle imperiousness:</p>

<p>"Tell your master there is a young lady to see him."</p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply, Kathleen brushed past
the astonished servant, entered a small reception-room
on her right, and sat down to await the entrance of her
father.</p>

<p>She had not mentioned her name, because she wanted
to take him by surprise.</p>

<p>She wanted to see the joy-light flash into his handsome
face when she should throw herself into his arms and
cry out, tenderly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Papa, darling, it is I, your little Kathleen, come home
to you again!"</p>

<p>How glad he would be to see her again! He had always
loved her so fondly that his heart must have almost
broken when they told him she was dead.</p>

<p>And how glad he would be to have her back again.
How his eyes would flash when she told him how wretchedly
she had been treated. He would certainly call in
the strong arm of the law to punish her persecutors.
Only she did not want them to do anything to old Mrs.
Hoover, the kind matron who had befriended her in the
asylum.</p>

<p>She sunk down into a beautiful satin chair with a sigh
of relief at getting back to papa and home again&mdash;her
beautiful home, so warm, so luxurious, filled with the rich
odor of hot-house flowers, in strong contrast to the storm
raging bleakly outside.</p>

<p>The man-servant, somewhat amazed at her coolness in
entering the reception-room, but supposing her to be some
intimate friend of the family, went in search of his mistress.</p>

<p>"A young lady is in the small reception-room asking
for Mr. Belmont," he said.</p>

<p>He had naturally supposed that Kathleen meant Ivan
Belmont, as he was the only man connected with the
house.</p>

<p>"Did you send Mr. Belmont to her?"</p>

<p>"He had just gone out, madame, and she did not wait
for me to tell her, but brushed past me and went into the
room," he replied.</p>

<p>"Impertinent!" exclaimed the lady, in angry surprise.
"I will go and see what she wants," she added, rising and
throwing down her novel to go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>She was already in a towering rage, because she had
been bullied by Ivan into giving him five hundred dollars
a few minutes ago, and the idea that a woman, one of his
low associates, most probably, had had the effrontery to
follow him here, added fuel to the flame of her fury.</p>

<p>Kathleen heard the swish of a silken robe, and the
heavy curtains parted and fell behind the tall and stately
form of her handsome step-mother.</p>

<p>The girl rose up&mdash;grieved that it was not her father,
but so glad to be safe at home again that she was almost
glad to see again the wicked woman who was the cause
of all her trouble.</p>

<p>"Mamma!" she faltered, using the name she had been
taught to give her cruel step-mother, and Mrs. Carew,
who had been advancing angrily toward her, recoiled with
a smothered cry and starting eyes.</p>

<p>Kathleen came toward her with eager, imploring hands
outstretched in greeting.</p>

<p>"Do not be frightened, mamma, I am not a ghost, I
am human," she said, sweetly; but Mrs. Carew, who had
sunk down on her knees in mortal terror, waved her back.</p>

<p>"Back, back!" she breathed, hoarsely; and Kathleen
saw that she believed herself haunted by the spirit of her
dead step-daughter.</p>

<p>She went back to her seat and began to explain her
appearance in soothing tones:</p>

<p>"It was all a mistake, mamma. I was in a trance, not
really dead, and I came to myself in the coffin that night,
and dazed and frightened lest they should bury me alive,
I ran away into the woods. Some people caught me and put
me into a lunatic asylum, from which I have just escaped!"</p>

</div></div>


<p>Mrs. Carew drew a long, sobbing breath, and struggled
up to a chair, keeping her eyes fixed fearfully on Kathleen,
who went on sorrowfully:</p>

<p>"I can not tell you mamma, what I have suffered since
I went away last spring. The recital would be enough to
melt a heart of stone. You never loved me, I know, but
you would have pitied me if you could have known how
I was suffering from the stupidity of those people, who
took me for another girl, and kept me a prisoner so many
months. Thank Heaven, it is all over now, and I am at
home again. But where is papa? I want to see him so
much, and I am sure he can not be out this stormy night."</p>

<p>While the young girl talked, the color had been coming
back to Mrs. Carew's lips and a malevolent gleam to her
blue eyes. Straightening herself up in her chair, she
looked across at the girl, realizing that it was indeed
Kathleen Carew come back from the portals of death.</p>

<p>She had always hated the lovely, innocent girl, and
now she thought triumphantly that Kathleen's day was
past. Her father was dead, and she was disinherited.
She had no part nor lot in the home to which she had
returned.</p>

<p>The cruel woman looked at the lovely young suppliant,
and sneered:</p>

<p>"You can not impose on me with your false claims.
You are not Kathleen Carew, and your resemblance to her
is very slight&mdash;not strong enough to bear out your assertion.
My step-daughter is dead."</p>

<p>"No, no!" Kathleen cried, piteously. "I am your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
step-daughter, indeed I am, mamma, and I have told you
the truth. I have been so ill and unhappy all these
months, it is that which has changed my looks and made
me look so unlike the Kathleen you remember. Where
is papa? He will know me, he will be glad that I am
alive!" She made a movement to leave the room, but
as suddenly Mrs. Carew barred her way.</p>

<p>"You lunatic! you shall not leave this room!" she
hissed, savagely.</p>

<p>Kathleen's hot temper, held at bay so long, flamed
up at once.</p>

<p>"I <i>will</i> go to papa!" she uttered, angrily; and in a low
but perfectly clear voice her tormentor answered:</p>

<p>"Vincent Carew is <i>dead</i>!"</p>

<p>She saw the girl start and tremble as if she had been
struck. Her sweet face, flushed a moment ago with anger,
went deathly white, and she clutched the back of a chair
for support.</p>

<p>"Vincent Carew is dead!" repeated the pitiless woman
before her. She heard a moan of mortal agony issue
from Kathleen's pale lips, but she continued, heartlessly:
"My husband was lost at sea in the <i>Urania</i>, that was
burned to the water's edge the very week after my step-daughter
was murdered in Pennsylvania. By his will,
made in London just before he sailed, he disinherited his
daughter for her intimacy with an actor, and left his
whole fortune to me and my daughter."</p>

<p>"It is monstrous, impossible! You are telling me a
falsehood!" moaned Kathleen, with difficulty, for her
senses were leaving her under the shock of her step-mother's
words. A low gasp came from her lips, she
staggered blindly forward, then fell insensible upon the
carpet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Carew spurned the senseless form with her foot
and threw wide the velvet <i>portière</i>, calling:</p>

<p>"Jones, lift this woman up and put her out into the
street. And be careful never to admit disreputable characters
inside my doors again, or you may lose your
place!"</p>

<p>The man, who had been lingering about very near, approached
with profuse apologies and excuses.</p>

<p>"Carry her out into the street!" repeated his mistress,
angrily.</p>

<p>Jones took up the light, unconscious figure in his arms
and moved toward the door, but he muttered, deprecatingly:</p>

<p>"She'll die out there in the snow."</p>

<p>"What is that to you? Creatures like <i>her</i> ought to be
dead! Do as you are bid, or you will rue it!" stormed
his mistress; and Jones, dazed and frightened by her violence,
hastened to obey her commands.</p>

<p>The door had hardly closed on him as he bore poor
Kathleen out into the stormy night, when Alpine Belmont,
disturbed by the noise, came gliding down the stairs, demanding
the cause of the excitement.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carew was pale and trembling in every limb, and
she answered, reluctantly:</p>

<p>"It's something not fit for a young girl's ears, my
dear."</p>

<p>"Oh, bosh! I'll find out from the servants if <i>you</i>
don't tell me," retorted Alpine; and then Mrs. Carew
said, cunningly:</p>

<p>"Well, if you must know such awful things, a woman
came here demanding to see that disreputable brother
of yours! You can imagine the sort of woman, crazy
with drink, that would follow <i>him</i>! So I made Jones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
put her out into the street, and the whole disgraceful
thing will be talked over by the servants by to-morrow."</p>

<p>Alpine shivered with horror and disgust, and muttered:</p>

<p>"I wish Ivan was dead! He is too wicked to live!
The idea of that woman's effrontery!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Carew thought to herself:</p>

<p>"That was a good idea of mine! She believes every
word. Good! for I would not like for her to know the
truth. She has been so soft over that girl ever since
her supposed death, that there's no telling what pity
would lead her to do!"</p>

<p class="center">TEDDY DARRELL AGAIN.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The snow lies white and the moon gives light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll out to the freezing mere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I'll tell my mind to the friendly wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because I have loved her so.<br /></span>
<span class="i26"><span class="smcap">Ingelow</span>.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Mrs. Carew's servant, Jones, was a very humane and
tender-hearted man, and his heart swelled with anger
as he obeyed the command of his mistress, and bore the
fainting young girl out of the splendid abode of luxury
and wealth into the cold and stormy night.</p>

<p>He stopped under the flaring street-lamp and looked
pityingly into the lovely white face that had fallen back
against his arm.</p>

<p>"Why, what a pretty young thing she is&mdash;little more
than a child&mdash;and looks as innocent, too!" he soliloquized.
"I'll bet my life that if she's ever done any
harm, she's been betrayed into it by that scoundrelly
Ivan Belmont that she came here to find! He ought
to be hung, so he ought!"</p>

<p>He glanced anxiously up and down the almost deserted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
avenue. The snow lay white and deep upon the ground,
and the great flakes swirled through the air, striking
him coldly in the face.</p>

<p>"If I put her down here on the ground she will freeze
to death, poor girl, that's certain!" he murmured, uneasily.
"I just can't do such a wicked thing&mdash;no, not
even if she <i>is</i> bad, as Mrs. Carew said. Why, even if she
was a murderess it wouldn't be right to leave her out
here to die in the cold! But, land, what be I to do with
her? That's what I want to know!"</p>

<p>The whinny and stamp of an impatient horse attracted
his attention at that moment. He turned his head and
saw a smart cab waiting at the next door. The driver,
half asleep, sat on his box, his head sunk into the collar
of his great-coat.</p>

<p>A sudden temptation came to the troubled Jones, and
he did not fight against it, but rather welcomed it as an
inspiration.</p>

<p>Walking noiselessly across the snow, Jones placed his
burden inside the cab upon the cushions, and closed the
door so softly that it did not attract the attention of the
tired and sleepy driver on the box.</p>

<p>"God bless you and raise you up a friend this awful
night, you poor little wretch!" apostrophized Jones, as
he returned from the scene and re-entered the Carew
mansion.</p>

<p>He had not been gone ten minutes before a servant
came from the house before which the cab was waiting
and roused the sleepy cabby.</p>

<p>"The lady as you brought here has decided to stay
all night with her sick mother, so she told me to pay you
and send you away," he said.</p>

<p>"All right, but I wish she had made up her mind afore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
she kep' me a-waitin' here all night! I be frozen with the
cold, that's what I be!" grumbled the driver, accepting
the double fee ungraciously, and driving away at a high
rate of speed, all unconscious of the silent passenger
inside.</p>

<p>He went rattling down to a large hotel, hoping he
might get a fare for the theater.</p>

<p>A tall, handsome young man came down the steps and
hailed him.</p>

<p>"Take me to the Opera House," he said, opening the
door and springing lightly in.</p>

<p>"All right, sir," and away they went.</p>

<p>Teddy Darrell, the new fare, pulled up the collar of
his long, fur-lined overcoat about his ears, and was about
to settle himself comfortably when he received a violent
shock.</p>

<p>He discovered that he was not alone in the cab. A
slight girlish form, shrouded in a heavy cloak, was huddled
up on the opposite seat, and low moans were issuing
from its lips.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>

<p class="center">"I WOULD LAY DOWN MY LIFE TO SERVE YOU!" SAID TEDDY.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">How was any one to know<br /></span>

<span class="i26"><span class="smcap">John T. Trowbridge</span>.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Teddy Darrell had had some adventures in his day,
and was not given to nerves, so he did not let the shock
of his discovery overcome him.</p>

<p>The thought flashed over him that some drunken
woman had crept into the cab, unknown to the driver, and
fallen into a troubled slumber.</p>

<p>The flaring lanterns on the outside of the cab did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
afford much light, so Teddy struck a match and held it
over the face of his unknown companion.</p>

<p>Then indeed he had a shock much greater than the first
one.</p>

<p>The lighted match fell from his hand and he recoiled
with a startled cry.</p>

<p>"Good heavens! what a likeness!"</p>

<p>He sunk upon the opposite seat, actually trembling with
surprise and emotion.</p>

<p>In the pale and lovely face lying unconscious on the
cushions the young man had recognized a haunting likeness
to one he had loved very dearly, and whose tragic
fate, six months ago, had thrilled him with unutterable
horror. Although other lovers had succeeded Kathleen in
Teddy's young, impressionable heart, he had never ceased
to regret the fact that she had rejected him.</p>

<p>"The sweetest, loveliest girl in all the world!" he had
always thought of bonny, dark-eyed Kathleen.</p>

<p>And he trembled with pain when he saw in the poor
street waif, as he believed her, the awful likeness to his
lost loved one.</p>

<p>Kathleen, who was beginning to recover consciousness,
moaned and stirred, half lifting herself toward the young
man.</p>

<p>He bent toward her kindly and said:</p>

<p>"Are you ill, madame?"</p>

<p>That voice! It was one from her happy past. It
stirred a pulse in Kathleen's heart, and she turned toward
him wildly, her dark eyes opening wide upon his anxious
face.</p>

<p>The flaring lights from some place of amusement shone
into the cab and showed her his features.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>"Teddy Darrell!" she murmured, in a feeble tone of
amazement.</p>

<p>"Good heavens! you know me!" he exclaimed. "Who
are <i>you</i>?"</p>

<p>She held out her white hands to him with an entreating
gesture.</p>

<p>"Don't you know me? Don't you remember Kathleen
Carew?" she cried, faintly.</p>

<p>"Kathleen Carew is <i>dead</i>!" he answered, blankly.</p>

<p>"No, no; she lives! It was a mistake. I was in a
trance, and I escaped from my coffin and ran away into
the woods," whispered the girl, rapidly regaining the
strength to speak.</p>

<p>"Good heavens! So that's what became of you!"
cried Teddy Darrell. He seized her little white hands and
pressed them rapturously. "Welcome back to life, my
dear girl!" he laughed, happily, and she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"You know me&mdash;you believe me?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do," he replied, joyously. "But how
came you to be here in this cab, alone and unconscious?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," she answered, in a puzzled voice. "I
went home, and mamma told me my father was dead,
and that he had disinherited me in his will. Then she
denied my identity, and the last thing I remember I fell
fainting on the carpet. Oh, Mr. Darrell! will you do me
one favor? Take me to my dear friend, Helen Fox."</p>

<p>"Helen Fox is in Europe," he replied, reluctantly.</p>

<p>"In Europe? Oh, good heavens! what am I to do,
then? Helen is the only friend I have to turn to in my
distress!" exclaimed the young girl, clasping her beautiful
hands in the keenest despair.</p>

<p>Teddy Darrell looked at her reproachfully.</p>

<p>"You seem to forget <i>me</i>, Miss Carew. But I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
lay down my life to serve you!" he exclaimed, impetuously.</p>

<p>She glanced up and met his eyes. They wore the
most killing expression of devotion&mdash;and Teddy's dark
eyes could be very expressive when he chose.</p>

<p>Kathleen blushed vividly, and answered:</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;did not know&mdash;if I might call you my friend or
not. Some men&mdash;might not like a young girl after&mdash;after&mdash;&mdash;"
She paused in confusion.</p>

<p>"After she rejected him," finished Teddy, coolly.
"Well, I hope I am not as mean as that, Miss Carew. I
shall be only too happy to be your friend and brother if
you will allow me."</p>

<p>"You are too good to me," she whispered, gratefully, as
she held out her little white hand to him, adding, sadly:
"'A friend in need is a friend indeed,' and I am poor in
everything now, with not even a shelter for my head."</p>

<p>"Don't say that," exclaimed the sympathetic young fellow,
with a break in his voice. "I am going to take you
to my cousin, one of the kindest ladies in the world, if you
will allow me to do so;" and, pulling the check-string,
he gave the driver orders not to proceed to the opera
house, but to the street where his cousin lived.</p>

<p>Kathleen acquiesced gratefully in his decision. Her
heart went out warmly to this cordial friend, and she
regretted in her heart that she had ever laughed with
Helen Fox over the young man's flirting proclivities.</p>

<p class="center">ALPINE'S RENEWED HOPES.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And all my days are trances,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And all my nightly dreams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are where thy dark eye glances,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And where thy footstep gleams.<br /></span>
<span class="i26"><span class="smcap">Edgar Allan Poe</span>.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Alpine Belmont, all in a flutter of surprise and delight,
was making herself beautiful, with her maid's assistance,
for the eyes of a caller who was waiting for her in the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>Ten minutes ago a card had been brought to her bearing
the name of "Ralph Chainey."</p>

<p>"He asked for Mrs. Carew first, but I told him she was
out; then he sent his card to you," said Jones.</p>

<p>Alpine's heart leaped with wild delight.</p>

<p>She was as romantically in love with the gifted and
handsome young actor as was possible to one of her vain
and selfish nature.</p>

<p>After Kathleen's death she had cherished some hope
of winning him, but his coldness and indifference had
been so marked, and his despair over Kathleen's loss so
deep, that in angry pique she had given up her hopes, and
determined to console herself with her newly acquired
wealth.</p>

<p>The novelty of her position as a great heiress had for
a time diverted her thoughts, but of late they had returned
to him again, and rested longingly on her desire to win
his heart.</p>

<p>So the sudden announcement of his presence filled her
with joyful anticipations.</p>

<p>Her maid was hurriedly summoned to array her mistress
for the coming interview.</p>

<p>In the servants' hall, a little later, she expressed the
opinion that the gentleman must be a very particular beau,
as the lady was so hard to please.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Alpine, palpitating in a light-blue silk that
set off very becomingly her blonde beauty, was entering
the drawing-room to meet her caller.</p>

<p>Ralph Chainey, dark, stately, handsome, the incarnation
of a romantic young girl's idea of a lover, rose and
bowed with courtly grace over Miss Belmont's hand.</p>

<p>He had been searching vainly for Kathleen more than
a week, and at last it occurred to him that perhaps she
had come home. He hastened to Boston in a fever of
anxiety.</p>

<p>Alpine could never remember afterward in what words
he told his story, it came on her so suddenly, it found
her so unprepared, but presently she knew it all&mdash;knew
that Kathleen, whose death had so softened her heart,
was alive, and that but for some strange happening of
fate, she would that moment be Ralph Chainey's beloved
wife.</p>

<p>With that knowledge, Alpine's heart grew cold as ice
again; the old jealous hate revived.</p>

<p>She could not speak for some moments, but sat staring
with burning blue eyes at the unhappy young man, who
was pouring out his whole heart.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Belmont, think what an awful shock it was
to me, losing her in that mysterious fashion. I have
scarcely eaten or slept since, I have been so wretched, I
employed detectives, but they seem to be all at sea.
They even believe that I was mistaken&mdash;that it was not
Kathleen Carew at all, but really Daisy Lynn, a lunatic.
Miss Watts, from whom she had escaped, had been
found, and she declared that the girl was her niece."</p>

<p>A wild hope came into Alpine's mind, and she faltered:</p>

<p>"I believe the detectives are right. Kathleen can not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
be alive. Remember we saw her in her coffin, cold and
dead."</p>

<p>"Not dead, for I have seen her alive!" he exclaimed.
"Oh, Miss Belmont, do not discourage me&mdash;do not turn
unbelieving ears to my story, for I swear to you that
Kathleen Carew is alive to-night&mdash;alive, but given over to
some fate, perhaps, worse than death!"</p>

<p>Alpine's heart beat wildly as he fixed his great burning
brown eyes so sorrowfully upon her face. Oh, God! she
thought, what would she not give for Ralph Chainey to
love her as he did Kathleen Carew, her hated step-sister!</p>

<p>Some burning words of the Virginia poetess, Mittie Point Davis, came
into her mind:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If your heart could throb for me,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Even for a moment's space,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With the love I feel for thee<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Gazing on that glorious face;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">If the passion that I feel<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Found response within your breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Years of anguish could not steal<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Memories that I had been blest.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If those eyes so darkly glorious,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Kindled as with mine they met,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I could hold myself victorious<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Even though you did forget.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I could give the lifelong passion<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Of a thousand meaner souls<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For one hour's brief adoration<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Over thine to sway control."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Ralph Chainey did not dream what a wealth of love
for him had blossomed into full flower in the young girl's
heart. Men are blind, or they would never confide to one
beautiful young girl the story of their love for another
one. Few girls are noble enough to listen without being
piqued and jealous.</p>

<p>Alpine Belmont's heart burned within her, and she said
to herself that she hoped he was mistaken, and that poor
Kathleen was dead. She believed it herself, and she
and her mother had long ago agreed that Kathleen's
body had been stolen from the doctor's cottage for purposes
of dissection. She had shuddered at the thought
of that beautiful body being so desecrated, but Mrs. Carew
had seemed quite indifferent, and congratulated herself
that she had escaped the expenses of a fashionable funeral
and a costly monument.</p>

<p>All the sorrow she had felt for Kathleen's death died
out of Alpine's heart as she beheld the trouble of the
handsome young actor, and she said to herself that if
Kathleen could rise from the grave and stand before
her, she would be tempted to strike her dead at her feet.</p>

<p>While these cruel and jealous thoughts ran through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
Alpine's mind, Ralph Chainey was looking at her with
pathetic eyes that mutely craved her sympathy. At last
she began to understand this, and a clever idea came to
her. Why not pretend to sympathize with him in his sorrow?
It would bring them closer together, and perhaps
win her some kind thoughts from him.</p>

<p>Following out her thought, Alpine moved to a seat beside
the young actor, and laying her soft, ringed white
hand lightly upon his, she gave it a sympathetic pressure,
and murmured:</p>

<p>"No words can tell you how deeply I sympathize with
you in your sorrow. I hope, for both our sakes, that your
belief may prove true, and Kathleen be restored to your
heart."</p>

<p>Her sympathy pleased him, as she knew it would, and
he answered, eagerly:</p>

<p>"You loved her. I know. How could any one live in
the house with her and not be devoted to one so sweet and
lovely?"</p>

<p>Alpine withdrew her hand and played nervously with
her many rings.</p>

<p>"Yes. I was fond of Kathleen," she murmured. "You
did well to come to me. You have all my sympathy, and
oh! how I wish I could find her and restore her to you.
Is there nothing I can do? I am rich, you know, and if
you wish it, I will employ a detective to find Kathleen;"
but even as she breathed the tender words, the wily girl
knew that she would rather employ a detective to hunt
her rival down to her death.</p>

<p>Ralph Chainey, blind mortal that he was, looked at her
gratefully, without detecting the hollow ring in her voice.</p>

<p>"God bless you for your noble offer, Miss Belmont,
but I can not accept it," he replied. "I have detectives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
already employed. I, too, am rich, and my whole fortune
shall be devoted to finding her, if it costs that much. All
that you can do is to write to me at once if you hear from
our poor lost darling. I shall be moving from one city
to another, but I will keep you informed of my whereabouts."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, Mr. Chainey, and I will write you if I
have the least bit of news!" exclaimed Alpine, with
sparkling eyes, for she began to see a prospect of getting
up a correspondence with the great actor. She would
write to him often, asking if <i>he</i> had any news, and he
would be obliged, in common courtesy, to reply.</p>

<p>He rose to go, and Alpine poured out eloquently her
sympathy for him and her sorrow for Kathleen.</p>

<p>"We both love her; it is a link between us," she said.
"Try to think of me as a sister, and remember I shall
often be thinking of you in your sorrow."</p>

<p>He thanked her gratefully and hurried away, after
promising to call again the first time he came to Boston.</p>

<p>Alpine told her mother on her return of the young
man's visit, and his startling disclosure, but Mrs. Carew
pooh-poohed the whole story.</p>

<p>"Kathleen is certainly dead," she said. "Ralph
Chainey has been imposed on by a pretty lunatic, that's
all. I thought he had more sense."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">TEDDY DARRELL'S PLANS.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"You are all that I have to live for,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">All that I want to love,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">All that the whole world holds for me."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Teddy Darrell kept his promise to Kathleen. He took
her immediately to the home of his cousin, a widow lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
of about thirty-eight years&mdash;a woman of good circumstances
and social standing, but whose divided devotion
to two pretty children and literary pursuits caused her
to live a very retired life.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stone must have been very fond of her cousin
Teddy, for she accepted his story of the finding of Kathleen
in good faith, and made the young girl welcome to
her luxurious home. She saw that the hapless girl was
nearly fainting with fatigue, and leaving Teddy alone in
the pretty library, carried her off to bed, after first coaxing
her to take some tea and toast.</p>

<p>"Bless you, my dear, your name has been a familiar
one in this household for more than a year. Teddy was
so madly in love with you once that he could talk of nothing
else but Kathleen Carew whenever he came. Even
the children knew all about it!"</p>

<p>Kathleen blushed at receiving so much kindness from
Teddy's cousin, after having rejected <i>him</i>, so to clear
herself she said:</p>

<p>"But he got over it directly. Helen Fox told me he
proposed to her the week afterward."</p>

<p>Mrs. Stone, who was warming a dainty lace-ruffled
night-gown before the fire for her guest, threw her head
back and laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"Teddy Darrell is the worst flirt in Boston! Actually,
Miss Carew, I've known that boy to be engaged to three
girls at the same time!" she exclaimed, merrily.</p>

<p>"I suppose he can never be really in earnest," said the
young girl.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Stone replied, more seriously:</p>

<p>"I have never known him to be in earnest but once,
and I have been his confidante, I believe, in all of his
love affairs. He has had many fancies, but he never
really loved any one but <i>you</i>, my dear girl."</p>

<p>Kathleen did not know what to say to this, and the
lady rattled on:</p>

<p>"Well, Teddy is a good catch, if I do say it myself,
for he is a real good boy, and very rich. His wife, if he
ever gets one, will have a happy life; and I hope he will
soon marry, for that would cure him of his little fads."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fads?" observed Kathleen, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied her new friend; "he is full of them.
Some time ago it was to be an author, and I believe he
wrote up whole reams of foolscap in the six weeks while
the fever lasted. He came here every day, bringing
dozens of pages of the thrilling romance over which he
had been wasting the midnight oil. Finally he sent it
off to a publisher, and a prompt rejection cooled his
ardor. Now his fad is to be an actor."</p>

<p>"An actor?" Kathleen exclaimed.</p>

<p>Her thoughts flew with exquisite pain to Ralph Chainey&mdash;so
beloved and so false!</p>

<p>"He has been stage-struck ever since he saw Ralph
Chainey act last winter," continued the communicative
hostess. "He tells me now that he is studying to go upon
the stage, but I'm sure he will fail. He will certainly
have stage-fright."</p>

<p>"I hope not," answered Kathleen; and then the gentle
lady tucked her kindly into bed as if she had been a
little child.</p>

<p>"Good-night, my dear," she said, with a kiss, and then
she went away, saying she must go down-stairs and see
Teddy Darrell.</p>

<p>He was waiting for her alone. The children who
had been amusing him, had gone off to bed, and he settled
himself for a long, confidential chat.</p>

<p>From his talk she soon learned that his love of a year
ago for bonny Kathleen had revived with fuller intensity
than ever.</p>

<p>"Cousin Carrie, I'm bound to marry that girl!" he exclaimed,
with sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>"But she rejected you last winter, Teddy."</p>

<p>"I know; but everything is different now. She was a
belle and heiress then; now she is poor, and friendless
but for us. When she learns that I love her in spite of
her changed position, and that I want to marry her as
soon as she will have me, she will be touched by the
romance of the affair, and&mdash;now don't laugh so, Cousin
Carrie&mdash;it <i>is</i> romantic, is it not, my devotion?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly," she agreed, merrily; then added: "But
I'm afraid you will find it hard to convince her of your
devotion; for she told me when I spoke of it just now
that you had proposed to Helen Fox the very week after
she rejected you."</p>

<p>Teddy made a grimace.</p>

<p>"Oh, that was all fun, and I think it was very shabby
in Helen telling all the other girls about it. Of course,
I only wanted the engagement for a few weeks, then to
pique her and get discarded, as I've done with other,
girls," he said, carelessly, having a very elastic conscience
in matters of love.</p>

<p>But he added, rather lugubriously:</p>

<p>"But I'm in earnest, Carrie, with Kathleen Carew.
Positively, she is the only girl I ever loved in my life&mdash;that
is, real, sure enough love&mdash;and it will break my
heart if I don't get her for my wife."</p>

<p>"You didn't break your heart when you believed that
she was dead," his cousin reminded him, cynically.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's different!" he replied, vaguely. "I've set
my heart on getting her now, and I could never get over
it, if I failed. Look here, Cousin Carrie," leaning toward
her, his bright, dark eyes full of tender pleading,
"help me, won't you? Speak a good word for me to her.
I'm not such a bad sort, am I?" wheedlingly. "I would
make a nice young girl a good husband, wouldn't I,
now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Teddy, I believe you would."</p>

<p>"Then help me, won't you? It's not selfish in me, is it,
to want to marry this poor girl who has been so strangely
despoiled of home and fortune, and make up to her for
all her cruel loss?"</p>

<p>He was deeply, romantically in earnest, and Mrs. Stone
could not help admiring his nobility.</p>

<p>"No, Teddy, it's not selfish, for you <i>are</i> a good match,
and I'll help you with sweet Kathleen, if I can. I used
to be called a good match-maker in other days when I
went more into society, and I'll exert my powers now for
your benefit."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you over and over!" he exclaimed, fervently.</p>

<p>Thus in two homes in Boston plans were being made to
keep Ralph Chainey and Kathleen apart. Teddy Darrell
meant to marry his old sweetheart, if she was to be won,
and Alpine Belmont was scheming to marry Ralph.
These two hearts, that had gone out so tenderly in love
to each other, seemed but footballs of fate, tossed relentlessly
hither and thither. Well might Kathleen, tossing
restlessly on her soft bed, wet the pillow with bitter,
burning tears for her lost love&mdash;her false love, as she believed.</p>

<p>Kathleen had promised to write to Samuel Hall and
let him know when she arrived safely in Boston, and the
next morning, although she felt really weak and ill, she
kept her promise.</p>

<p>She wrote a kind and grateful letter to the noble clerk,
again thanking him for his goodness to her, and telling
him of her terrible disappointment on reaching home.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I can not understand it all, I am so dazed with my
trouble," she wrote. "But papa is dead&mdash;lost at sea&mdash;and
the strangest thing I ever heard of, he made a will
just before he sailed for America, and disinherited me&mdash;his
only child. Think of the strangeness&mdash;the cruelty of
it. But he is dead; I must not harbor unkind thoughts
of him. I am sure some malignant influence was brought
to bear. But I am homeless, penniless, but for this friend,
Mrs. Stone, with whom I am staying. I can not now repay
you the sum of money you so nobly advanced me to
return home on, but I shall never forget it, and the time
may come when I shall be able to restore it fourfold.
Till then God bless you is the prayer of your friend till
death.</p>

<p class="smcap sig">"Kathleen Carew."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>Sammy Hall was all excitement over the letter, and at
the first opportunity confided the news to his sympathetic
girl friends.</p>

<p>Of course they talked it over at that quietest hour in
the day when the throng of shoppers are out at lunch or
gone home to dinner.</p>

<p>Tessie Mays, who had the news direct from Sammy,
retailed it all to the eager listeners; and no one noticed a
handsome, showily dressed young woman who had entered
the store and come up to Tessie's counter&mdash;Fedora, who,
having given the wrong address the other day, had now
returned to complain that she had never received her
package of gold passementerie.</p>

<p>Just as she was approaching the counter she heard
the name of Kathleen Carew called, and drawing back
with a great start, pretended to be examining some
gorgeous brocade silk that was displayed on the end of
the counter. The pretty, animated young girls did not
observe her, and went on talking.</p>

<p>Fedora did not lose a word.</p>

<p>Pretty soon she became aware that her prey had escaped
her through the efforts of Sammy Hall, and that
she was now safe in Boston with a friend, although her
father was dead and had disinherited her, and her step-mother
had denied her identity.</p>

<p>"It is just like a novel, isn't it?" commented one of
the young girls. "I would give anything I own for one
good look at the beautiful Miss Kathleen Carew, with
the bronze-gold hair and proud dark eyes that Sammy
raves over."</p>

<p>"Tessie Mays, I'd think you would be jealous!" exclaimed
another girl, with a meaning laugh.</p>

<p>Tessie tossed her dark curly head carelessly.</p>

<p>"Why, Sammy Hall is not my beau! I think it was
you, Dolly Wade, that he took to church Sunday night&mdash;wasn't
it?"</p>

<p>It was Dolly's turn to blush and bridle. She laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw! Mr. Hall's only a friend of mine, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
don't think he wants to marry you, anyhow! He is cut
out for an old bachelor if ever a man was!"</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen that woman again, Tessie?"
asked another girl, turning the conversation.</p>

<p>"What woman?"</p>

<p>"Why, the one that Sammy recognized and is going
to arrest, if she ever comes in here again, for kidnapping
Miss Carew."</p>

<p>"Why, no; and it's strange, too, for she made a mistake,
gave me the address of a vacant house, and her gold
passementerie came back here. I was certain she would
be back here, fussing about it; and I tell Sammy it's
lucky she made the mistake, so she will <i>have</i> to come back
here. He has the warrant for her arrest, and she'll never
get out of Haines &amp; Co.'s without a policeman's escort!"</p>

<p>"Won't she?" muttered Fedora, with a low, gurgling
laugh of sarcastic amusement. She tripped away in a
hurry, in spite of her pretended mirth, and did not breathe
freely until she was out of the store and in the cab that
was waiting for her near the sidewalk.</p>

<p>"Whew! what a narrow escape!" she muttered. "So
I have been watched and almost trapped while I believed
myself triumphant!"</p>

<p>An ugly look crossed the pretty blonde face, and she
continued, angrily:</p>

<p>"I wonder who Sammy Hall can be that those girls
talked about so familiarly? He must be the man that
helped me put the girl in the carriage, and that I met
afterward in the street, and snubbed so coolly. He has
taken revenge on me by ferreting out the place where I
left Kathleen Carew, and rescuing her from her fate.
Heigho! I think I had better leave for New York right
away. Philadelphia will be too hot a place to hold me
for a while. If I had the money I would go to Boston
and look up my runaway bird, and Ivan at the same
time. He promised to send me three hundred dollars
this week. He had better do it, for I've got a hold on
him, now, thanks to that girl's disclosure, that he can't
shake off."</p>

<p>"You must cheer up, dear Kathleen, and feel yourself
quite at home with me," Mrs. Stone said, affectionately,
to her sorrowful young guest.</p>

<p>Kathleen looked at her wistfully with her sad, dark
eyes.</p>

<p>"But I have no claim on your kindness, dear lady," she
sighed.</p>

<p>"Why, aren't you my cousin Teddy's friend? and isn't
he one of the best boys in the world? and didn't I promise
his dead mother that I would always be kind to the boy
she was leaving so lonely in the wide world? for his
father had died years before. Yes, indeed, you have a
claim on me, not alone because Teddy loves you so passionately,
but for your own dear sake&mdash;because your
trouble and your helplessness make it my duty to love
and care for you," exclaimed the kind lady, feelingly.</p>

<p>"You are so good and kind! May Heaven reward
you!" sobbed the unhappy girl.</p>

<p>She leaned her beautiful curly head on Mrs. Stone's
shoulder and wept bitter, burning tears from the depths
of her overcharged heart.</p>

<p>Poor Kathleen! She was surely the most unhappy girl
in the world.</p>

<p>So young, so lovely, and so loving, yet pursued by a
cruel, unrelenting fate, that had wrested from her little
hands all that she held dearest in life!</p>

<p>Her young heart was torn with agony for the death of
her beloved father, and the thought of Ralph Chainey's
sin added poignancy to her grief.</p>

<p>In the long, dark watches of the sleepless nights, poor,
unhappy Kathleen lay wakeful and wretched on her pillow,
thinking wildly of her lost love&mdash;the man who had
seemed like a demi-god in her eyes, so handsome, and
so gifted, and so noble, but who had been deceiving her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
all along&mdash;who had a wife while he was pretending he
meant to marry her.</p>

<p>And&mdash;but when it came to this thought Kathleen's
hysterical sobs almost choked her, and she said to herself
that she would not permit herself to believe it&mdash;the
thought that it was Ralph Chainey who had robbed her
that night, and given her jewels to <i>that</i> woman, was unendurable.
That way lay madness.</p>

<p>But it was no wonder that each morning, when the kind
eyes of her hostess scanned her face so anxiously, she
found it paler and paler, while the dark eyes were somber
and heavy from the tears that always lay so near them,
and the sweet, red lips had always a tremulous curve, as if
from repressed sobs.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stone's kind heart ached for the unhappy young
creature who only wept at all her attempts at comfort.</p>

<p>She said to herself that she did not believe there was
much chance for Teddy Darrell, after all. The girl did
not show the least interest when she spoke of her cousin.</p>

<p>Her whole heart seemed to be absorbed in grief for her
father's death, and in wonder over the fact that he had
been mysteriously angry with her, and given her share
of his wealth to her step-sister.</p>

<p>"Papa always loved me, and I never did anything to
vex him, so why did he hate me? Why did he leave his
poor Kathleen alone and penniless in the cold world?"
she would sob, piteously.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stone had no answer ready for that oft-repeated
inquiry. It was a mystery to her, too, why Vincent
Carew had done such a cruel and wicked thing. She did
not know that Mrs. Carew had brought about the whole
thing by her malicious cablegram. If she had only
waited until that strange telegram from Ralph Chainey
had been explained, how different Kathleen's fate would
have been!</p>

<p>Ill and penniless, the dead millionaire's beautiful young
daughter was as poor and wretched as any beggar in the
streets, only for this kind friend.</p>

<p>"Cheer up, my dear, cheer up!" she urged, kindly;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
but Kathleen could not even bring a smile to her poor,
stiff lips. Teddy Darrell came every day to inquire
after her, and he was shocked at the change in beautiful
Kathleen.</p>

<p>"She looks awfully ill&mdash;almost as if she were going
to die," he confided to his cousin after a week, in a
troubled tone.</p>

<p>"She <i>is</i> ill; I'm sure of it; for she eats no more than a
little bird, and she gets weaker every day. I think I had
better have the doctor up, don't you?" she answered,
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes; I'll send him when I go out," Teddy replied;
and then he went back to the young girl, who was lying
back in an easy-chair, trying to interest herself in a little
book of poems he had brought her with some flowers.</p>

<p>"Do you find anything pretty in it?" he asked, tenderly.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know. I'm afraid I've not tried," she
answered, penitently, ashamed that she could not seem
happier to these kind friends who were so good.</p>

<p>He took the book from her hands and began to read
aloud some pretty bits here and there, in a musical and
well-modulated voice.</p>

<p>"Listen to this. I am sure you will agree with me that it is pretty,"
he said, and read, softly:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Oh, Love, so sweet at first,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">So bitter in the end;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thou canst be fiercest foe<br /></span>
<span class="i4">As well as fairest friend.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Ay, thou art swift to slay,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Despite thy kiss and clasp,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy long, caressing look,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Thy subtle, thrilling grasp!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Yet, cruel as the grave.<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Just where it was before?<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The only gift of thine<br /></span>
<span class="i4">That shall outlive the years.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Kathleen's face was bent on her hand. Teddy heard a smothered sob, but
he did not know with what terrible directness the words had gone to her
heart. He believed that she was heart-whole and fancy-free.</p>

<p>"It is too sad for you, is it not?" he exclaimed. "I will read you
something brighter:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'They may talk of love in a cottage,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And bowers of trellised vine,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of nature bewitchingly simple,<br /></span>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'But give me a sly flirtation<br /></span>

<span class="i2">With music to play in the pauses,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And nobody very near.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Kathleen actually gave a soft little laugh, for Teddy
had read the lines with such gusto that he plainly betrayed
how much the sentiment was to his mind.</p>

<p>He started, flushed, then said, with his unvarying good
nature:</p>

<p>"Ah, how cruel! But never mind, so that I've made
you feel brighter. Have I, Kathleen?"</p>

<p>"You are too good to me," the girl answered, gratefully,
moved by his kindness.</p>

<p>"Too good! Ah, not one-half as good as I would like
to be, if only you would let me," cried the young man,
ardently. "Ah, Kathleen," he continued, impulsively,
"do you remember how I used to love you&mdash;how I begged
you to be my wife? My darling girl, I'm as fond of you
as ever. Won't you try to love me? I would be the
proudest boy in Christendom if you would marry me!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't talk to me of love&mdash;please don't!" cried Kathleen,
keeping her ardent lover at bay with two entreating
white hands.</p>

<p>"Well, I won't&mdash;at least not to-day; and I beg your
pardon, dear, if I've intruded on your grief with my
selfish love. But I thought&mdash;thought it might please you
to know that there was one who loved you even better
since your reverse of fortune than before," Teddy explained,
humbly.</p>

<p>"You are too good to me," she repeated as before,
incoherently, touched by his devotion, and contrasting it
in her mind with the treachery of that other one so dearly
loved, so deeply false.</p>

<p>"Then may I hope, Kathleen?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, no! I shall never love nor marry any
one!" she answered, vehemently; but Teddy Darrell did
not in the least believe her. He thought that all young
girls were sure to love some day, and almost certain to
marry. He determined to keep on hoping and trying to
win this peerless beauty.</p>

<p>Kathleen guessed what his thoughts were, and it made
her very uneasy.</p>

<p>"If I remain here with his cousin he will expect me
to marry him," she thought. "I can not do it, for I do
not love him. I must go away again;" and that very
day she wrote to her mother's relatives in Richmond&mdash;the
ones to whom she was going when overtaken by such
an awful fate at Lincoln Station.</p>

<p>Kathleen was so weak that it tired her now even to
write a letter, and the pen dragged wearily before she
finished the recital of her sorrows, and pleaded with these
unknown kin to let her come to them just for a little
while&mdash;until she was strong enough to go out into the
wide, cruel world and earn her own living with those
weak, white hands.</p>

<p class="center">KATHLEEN'S WEARY WAITING.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh! you tangled my life in your hair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas a silken and golden snare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But so gentle the bondage my soul did implore<br /></span>

</div></div>


<p>Teddy Darrell sent up a doctor to see Kathleen, and
he was startled when he found that the young girl was
suffering from arsenical poisoning.</p>

<p>"It is quite well that you sent for me, because if this
had gone any further, she might have died. But I will
go at once to work to remove the effects of the poison
from her system," Doctor Spicer said, gravely.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stone was shocked, but she readily comprehended
that the woman Fedora had placed the deadly drug in
Kathleen's food, intending to compass her death by slow
degrees. What mystified her was the woman's motive.</p>

<p>Kathleen, while confiding the rest of her harrowing
story to these kind friends, Teddy Darrell and his cousin,
had withheld the story of Ralph Chainey's connection
with her trouble. She could not bring herself to mention
his name. Something in her heart pleaded mutely
for the culprit. What if the woman had lied to her?
What if she had been lured from Ralph by a cunning
ruse? Her brain reeled sometimes with this suspicion,
and she felt that she should go mad with the miserable
uncertainty of it all. Where was Ralph? Oh, if she
could only see him&mdash;find out the real truth!</p>

<p>So she did not tell her friends anything about Ralph,
and Mrs. Stone had no clew to the mystery of this attempt
on her life.</p>

<p>"She does not dream of it, and perhaps it will be as
well not to tell her, she has already suffered so much
through her unknown foes," thought the kind lady.</p>

<p>Several weeks passed, and Kathleen began to grow
stronger and better under the physician's treatment, but
in all this time no reply to her letter to her Southern relatives
had been received. Neither had the fact of Kathleen's
return to Boston ever transpired among her former
friends in the city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Carew was the only one who knew that Kathleen
really lived, and it was to her interest to keep it a secret.</p>

<p>Teddy Darrell remained silent on the subject, because
the natural selfishness of a lover made him wish to keep
away all other lovers until he had had his own chance</p>

<p class="center">
"To win or lose it all."<br />
</p>

<p>Mrs. Stone's quiet and retired life helped to keep Kathleen's
presence in her house unknown. She was a rising
authoress, devoted to her children and her pen. She
had first commenced to write after her husband's death
as a solace to her loneliness and grief. Success had made
literature her life work, and she devoted herself to it,
going but little into society and receiving few friends.</p>

<p>Kathleen began to look better, but she chafed bitterly
in secret over the strange silence of her relatives.</p>

<p>Why would they not write her a few lines, even if they
did not want her with them? Did they care nothing, then,
for the unhappy child of their poor dead Zaidee? She
had written to them so frankly, so appealingly, tried to
open her whole heart to them, but there came no response.</p>

<p>And dearly as she loved her good friend, Mrs. Stone,
Kathleen chafed at her enforced dependence on her
kindness. She saw so plainly through her little matchmaking
scheme, and she was so touched by Teddy's devotion,
silent and unobtrusive since that day when he had
spoken out so impulsively, but still patent to all observers.</p>

<p>She was so lonely, so friendless; and she knew it was
nobler in him to cling to her now when she was no longer
a belle and heiress, but only a waif tossed back almost
from the grave into a world that denied and disowned
her. Teddy never seemed to remember that. He was as
courteous and deferential as he had ever been to Miss
Carew, the courted heiress. Every day he brought her
gifts of books and flowers; often he came with a carriage
to take her and Mrs. Stone to ride. He did not
speak to Kathleen of his love again, but his great black
eyes looked unutterable things, and she knew that, despite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
his usual variableness, he was true, at least, to this
love.</p>

<p>Yes, Teddy's heart was touched for once, and he loved
bonny Kathleen even more warmly than in the former
time when:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"She had all that love could give, all that makes it sweet to live&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fond caresses, jewels, dresses; and with eloquent appeal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many a proud and rich adorer knelt&mdash;in metaphor&mdash;before her."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Teddy could not realize but that Kathleen would return
his love some time. He knew he was "a catch," in
worldly parlance, and he knew that he was good to look
upon. Why, then, should not beautiful Kathleen learn to
love him? Other girls had found it easy to do so&mdash;girls
for whom he had not cared an iota, only to amuse himself.</p>

<p>This was different. Teddy&mdash;flirting Teddy&mdash;had found
heaven at last in a girl's eyes!&mdash;deep, dark eyes like shady
pools in their thick fringes. Her glance thrilled him; the
touch of her soft, cool little hand burned like fire. He
could think of nothing but his love for her, and his desire
to marry her and lift her again to her old proud position.</p>

<p>"Once my wife, she should queen it over that <i>fat</i> Alpine
Belmont, who got all her money," he said to his
cousin. "She should have one of the finest houses in
Boston, horses and carriages, jewels and fine dresses, and
I would worship the very ground she trod on!"</p>

<p>Kathleen gave up all hope of ever hearing from her
Southern relatives.</p>

<p>"They do not care for me, and I must not expect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
anything of them," she sighed, and the thought came to
her that now she had been at Mrs. Stone's six weeks, and
grown well and strong again, she must seek a situation
as a teacher and support herself.</p>

<p>"I suppose I could teach little children, and I must
try to find some place. It is unfair to my kind friend
for me to remain here longer," she sighed, and stole
softly down to the library for a morning paper to consult
the advertisements.</p>

<p>As the girl glided softly across the floor a low murmur
of voices reached her through the falling curtains
from the adjoining parlor.</p>

<p>The girl gave a violent start, and sunk tremblingly into
the nearest chair.</p>

<p>She was pale as death, and her heart beat violently
against her side.</p>

<p>What was it? What had startled the young girl so
much?</p>

<p>The sound of a voice had pierced her heart like a
sword-thrust.</p>

<p>It was Ralph Chainey's voice, so deep, so sweet, so
mellow, that, once heard, it could never be forgotten,
especially by one who loved him so despairingly as did
our poor Kathleen.</p>

<p>He was speaking to Mrs. Stone, and for one wild moment
Kathleen believed that he had traced her here, that
he had come to inquire for her. Surely then he could not
be guilty, or conscience would have kept him away.</p>

<p>She strained her ears to catch every tone of that deep,
sweet voice, and then she heard him speaking to Mrs.
Stone of her literary work. He had been so struck with
the force of one of her books that he wanted her to dramatize
it for him, or write him a new play.</p>

<p>All unaware of Kathleen's nearness to him, the young
actor had come here to this house, seemingly led by the
subtle hand of Fate.</p>

<p>Kathleen glided to the falling curtains, and, drawing
one ever so lightly apart, gazed with eager, yearning eyes
into the room.</p>

<p>Her hungry eyes feasted on the sight of her false lover
as he sat in full view, opposite Mrs. Stone, in a large
velvet arm-chair.</p>

<p>Never, it seemed to bonny Kathleen, had she seen him
look so grandly handsome, not even in his spirited impersonation
of Prince Karl, in which he had so thrilled her
girlish heart.</p>

<p>But Ralph Chainey was pale, and in his splendid,
thoughtful brown eyes lay the haunting shadow of a cruel
pain. He was tortured by his failure to find lost Kathleen.</p>

<p>But the conventional smile that played over his handsome
face as he talked to the gifted woman before him
deceived Kathleen. It seemed to her that he was well and
happy, that he had forgotten that she ever lived&mdash;the girl
he had pretended to love so dearly.</p>

<p>"I have the plot of a new story upstairs in my study,
and I believe it is just the thing you want, Mr. Chainey,"
said Mrs. Stone, vivaciously. She rose, and added: "I
will go and get it, but if I am some little time away, please
go into the library, and amuse yourself with a book. I
must confess that I am very careless, and often misplace
my manuscripts."</p>

<p>Mrs. Stone vanished through the door, and Ralph
Chainey, who was so unhappy that he dreaded nothing
so much as his own sad thoughts, immediately turned
toward the library.</p>

<p>Kathleen gave a gasp of surprise and terror, and
turned to fly.</p>

<p>She was too late. Even as her hand fell from the
curtain Ralph Chainey swept it aside and entered. The
strangely parted lovers were face to face.</p>

<p>For a moment the young man was only conscious that
Mrs. Stone's library was occupied by a beautiful young
girl.</p>

<p>But the moan that burst uncontrollably from Kathleen's
white lips made him glance more closely at the
young girl's face, and then he saw that it was his missing
love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>A cry of joyful astonishment broke from him, and he
sprung forward, crying, eagerly:</p>

<p>"Kathleen, my darling!"</p>

<p>His arms closed about her; he pressed her closely to
his throbbing breast.</p>

<p>Kathleen's eyes closed, and her golden head sunk
heavily on her lover's breast.</p>

<p>She had almost fainted with the shock of seeing him
so suddenly, combined with the exquisite rapture and
pain of his fond embrace.</p>

<p>But even while he showered kisses on her fair face
and closed eyes, memory and reason began to assert themselves.
She struggled faintly in his clasp, and he perceived
that she was trying to free herself.</p>

<p>Instantly he opened his arms and allowed her to go
free, for Ralph Chainey was one of the proudest of men,
and would not force his caresses on any one.</p>

<p>But he said eagerly, although with a slight tone of reproach
in his voice:</p>

<p>"Kathleen, my dearest, how came you here, and why
was it that I found you gone that night when I returned
to the station?"</p>

<p>The color flushed hotly into her pale face, but she
stood apart, looking at him with burning eyes, and not
uttering one word.</p>

<p>"Kathleen, why do you look at me so strangely?" exclaimed
her lover, in reproachful wonder. "Has your
heart changed toward me? Did you repent your promise
to marry me that night, and run away, or did your enemies
find you, as you feared they would? Tell me the
truth, my darling."</p>

<p>But still she did not speak. In truth, she could not.
There was a hysteric constriction in her throat that held
it tight as with iron bands. She gazed with unwilling
fascination into the large, pleading, brown eyes of her
lover, her young heart throbbing wildly in her breast.</p>

<p>"Kathleen, what have I done that you will not even
speak to me?" he asked, piteously, and all her heart
thrilled at the words; her will was hardly strong enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
to restrain her from springing into his arms. His glance,
deep, reproachful, loving, and magnetic, all in one, held
her like a charm:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It shot down her soul's deep heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Like a meteor trailing fire."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A long, long, troubled sigh breathed over the girl's
sweet lips, and with a great effort of her will she drooped
her eyelids so that they could not encounter his gaze.</p>

<p>"For I dare not, or&mdash;I should <i>risk</i> everything for his
dear love," she thought, wildly.</p>

<p>She mystified him so by her strange behavior that he
forgot his pride, and again advanced toward her side.</p>

<p>"Kathleen, my love, my darling, speak to me, if only
one word!" he cried, yearningly, passionately.</p>

<p>And finding her voice at last, she faltered to him, in a
despairing tone:</p>

<p>"Did you ever&mdash;ever&mdash;know&mdash;a woman named&mdash;Fedora?"</p>

<p>"My God!" cried Ralph Chainey.</p>

<p>He flung up one hand to his brow and reeled backward
from her side like one wounded to the death.</p>

<p>"So it is true?" Kathleen cried, in a hollow voice full
of bitter anguish.</p>

<p>Ralph Chainey looked at her with sad eyes from which
all the brightness had strangely faded.</p>

<p>"Who has told you?" he asked, in a dull voice.</p>

<p>"She told me herself," Kathleen answered, and shot
him an indignant glance, pride coming to her rescue.
There could no longer be any doubt of his guilt. His
looks confessed it.</p>

<p>But he faltered in a dazed voice:</p>

<p>"That is impossible! She is dead!"</p>

<p>"You can not deceive me like that, Ralph Chainey!"
cried Kathleen, in tempestuous anger. Her eyes flashed
lightning on her recreant lover, and she continued, bitterly:
"Your wife came to me that night in the station
and told me all. She&mdash;she took me away."</p>

<p>"What was she like?" demanded the young man,
hoarsely. He seemed dazed by sudden misery.</p>

<p>"She was a beautiful blonde with a haughty manner,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
answered Kathleen; and he groaned as if there could be
no longer any hope.</p>

<p>"I have been duped, deceived! I believed that Fedora
was dead long ago," he said, angrily. Then his voice
grew softer. "Kathleen, will you let me explain it all?"
he pleaded, humbly.</p>

<p>But in the heart of the beautiful, passionate young girl
there had suddenly leaped into life the devouring flame
of jealousy&mdash;jealousy and hate for the woman who had
thrust her rival into the pit of a black despair. And he
had deceived her. It seemed to her she must go mad with
her wrongs. In this moment she hated her lover.</p>

<p>She turned on him with a tigerish glare in her splendid
eyes.</p>

<p>"I will hear nothing!" she said, bitterly. "You will
never have the chance to deceive me again!" and she
rushed angrily from the room.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I can not break the cruel net,<br /></span>

</div></div>


<p>Kathleen gained her own room, locked the door, and
fell prostrate on the floor in a passion of blinding grief
and jealous anger. Tears came to her relief, and rained
down her cheeks in a tempest of emotion.</p>

<p>"Will he go away, or will he remain, tell Mrs. Stone
my whole story, and beg her to plead his cause with me?"
she asked herself, and hoped unconsciously that he would.</p>

<p>She did not know the young man's sturdy pride. He
had waited for Mrs. Stone, transacted his business with
her, and gone away without a word.</p>

<p>"She did not love me, or she would have let me explain
it all, as I wished. She did not care to have the
barrier between us swept away. So be it. Let her go.
She is not worthy such love as I gave her," he thought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
with scorn of the heart that could trample on such devotion:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i26">"The spirit of eager youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That named her queen of queens at once, and loved her in very truth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That threw its pearl of pearls at her feet, and offered her, in a breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The costliest gift a man can give from his cradle to his death."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His brow clouded with a heavy frown as he thought of
the woman who had turned the heart of his fair young
love so cruelly against him.</p>

<p>"Does she really live? Have I been duped by a cunning
lie&mdash;a trick to extort the price of a costly funeral?
I almost believe it. Let me find out if it is true, and bitter
shall be that fiend's punishment," he mused with almost
savage intensity.</p>

<p>He had reached Boston only that morning, and he had
promised Alpine Belmont, who had written to him almost
every day since he left, that he would call upon her very
soon. Wondering if she knew of Kathleen's presence in
the city, he bent his steps toward Commonwealth Avenue.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mrs. Stone, full of elation at the compliments
paid her by the gifted actor, and eager to share her
pleasure with Kathleen, went upstairs and tapped softly
on the door.</p>

<p>Kathleen opened it, and her friend started with surprise
at seeing her face flushed and her eyes swollen with
weeping.</p>

<p>"Do not mind me; it&mdash;it&mdash;is nothing," was all she
would say in reply to Mrs. Stone's sympathetic inquiries;
and at last the authoress plunged into her own affairs,
telling Kathleen all about Ralph Chainey's visit, and his
wish that she should write a play for him.</p>

<p>"He has taken away the plot of my new novel to read,
and he will return in a few days to tell me how he likes
it. If I succeed in pleasing him, I shall be famous!" she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I hope that you will succeed," Kathleen said, earnestly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you ever seen Ralph Chainey act, my dear,
and did you like him?"</p>

<p>"I have seen him, and I think he is a grand actor,"
the girl replied, quietly.</p>

<p>"How would you like to go and see him to-night?
He plays 'A Parisian Romance.' I am sure he will be
splendid in that, as he is in everything. We will take
Teddy with us. What do you say, my dear?"</p>

<p>Kathleen hesitated, her heart throbbing wildly with the
blended love and hate she now felt for the handsome
lover who had so wickedly deceived and betrayed her
girlish trust.</p>

<p>Then a sudden temptation came to her to stab his heart
as cruelly as he had done hers. Why not go with Teddy,
who loved her so dearly, and pretend to return his devotion?</p>

<p>"I should be delighted to go!" she said, unfalteringly
to Mrs. Stone.</p>

<p>"You startle me! Kathleen really alive? Kathleen
here, in the same city with us?" exclaimed Alpine Belmont,
in genuine surprise.</p>

<p>Ralph Chainey had been telling her all about his visit
to Mrs. Stone and his unexpected <i>rencontre</i> with his
lost love.</p>

<p>"Some one has been slandering me to her, and she
hates me now. She refused to have anything more to
do with me," he ended, with a long sigh.</p>

<p>The beauty's lashes fell to hide her blue eyes' exultant
gleam.</p>

<p>"Oh, how cruel of Kathleen!" she exclaimed. She
sighed, and added, in a low, tender voice: "How could
any one be cruel to <i>you</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>He hardly noticed the purport of her speech, he was
so absorbed in thought.</p>

<p>"You will go to her, Miss Belmont? You will bring
her home?" he pleaded.</p>

<p>"But perhaps she will not come with me. Is it not a
little strange that she did not come here at first, Mr.
Chainey?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is strange. There is something very mysterious
about this affair. But go to her, Miss Belmont,
and no doubt she will give you her confidence. Be her
friend, if she needs one," pleaded the lover, forgetting his
wrath against Kathleen in anxiety over her welfare.</p>

<p>"I will go to-morrow," promised Alpine, soothingly.</p>

<p>"And you will bring her home with you?"</p>

<p>"If she will come," answered Alpine. Then she gave
a violent start, exclaiming: "Oh, I've just remembered
something!"</p>

<p>"Well?" asked the young man, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Stone is own cousin to Teddy Darrell, and he
was Kathleen's lover last winter. Can there be any connection
between her being there with Mrs. Stone&mdash;whom
I'm certain she used not to know&mdash;and Teddy Darrell?"</p>

<p>The shaft went home. She saw him pale and tremble
with jealous dread.</p>

<p>"I know Teddy Darrell," he said, trying to speak carelessly.
"Did&mdash;did she ever care for <i>him</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe so. There was a flirtation anyway,
and we thought once it would be a match; but suddenly
it all came to nothing. I don't know who was to blame,
but I'm afraid it was Teddy. He's known to be fickle-minded
and a wretched flirt."</p>

<p>How sweetly and artlessly she spoke; but every word
was a sword-thrust in the hearer's heart. Wan and haggard
with misery, he rose and began to pace the floor
restlessly.</p>

<p>Alpine watched him under her down-drooped lashes,
her breast heaving with its love and pain. Yet she
knew that she was no more to him than a hundred other
girls whose names he barely knew, save and except that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
she was Kathleen's step-sister. She "was not the rose,
but she had lived near it."</p>

<p>It was cruelly hard, when she loved him so dearly.
The temptation seized her to fall at his feet, to cry out
to him that she could not live without him, that she was
going mad for his dear love.</p>

<p>She recoiled with horror from the thought. No, no;
he would despise her. Let her show him tenderness and
sympathy, but not love. By and by he might turn to
her when he became convinced that Kathleen was lost
to him forever.</p>

<p>"And she is, she shall be!" vowed the girl; and after
watching Ralph in silence for some moments, while he
strode up and down, seemingly oblivious of her presence,
she moved to his side, and slipping her hand timidly
within his arm, murmured, softly:</p>

<p>"Do not worry over it, please, dear friend. Even if
Kathleen is lost to you, there are hundreds of other
girls as well worth the winning."</p>

<p>He did not answer; he was dumb with despair; but
he suffered Alpine to cling to his arm and walk up and
down by his side, murmuring low words of sympathy
all the while.</p>

<p>"I shall scold Kathleen for her cruelty to you; you
did not deserve it, for you were true to her," she said, and
sighed. "Ah, how sad it is for one's love to prove false&mdash;false
and fickle!"</p>

<p>He turned on her almost fiercely.</p>

<p>"You believe that she loves this Darrell?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I believe she does," answered Alpine, with pretended
reluctance, exulting in the pain she saw on his face.</p>

<p>It gave her a savage joy to wound him in his love for
Kathleen. She longed to make him hate the hapless girl
as bitterly as she herself hated her.</p>

<p>"I must go," he said, abruptly; then as she clung to
his hand: "Do not forget your promise to go to her to-morrow.
And&mdash;you will send me a note? I play here
all this week."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, you shall hear from me. I shall see you again,
too, for I'm coming every night to see you act," she answered,
sweetly.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he replied, dropped her hand, and went
away, never remembering how lovingly the blue eyes had
looked into his, nor how tenderly she had spoken. It
was Kathleen of whom he was thinking&mdash;his sweet, estranged
love.</p>

<p>When the curtain rose that night on Ralph Chainey
in the beautiful play, "A Parisian Romance," there were
seated in opposite boxes the beautiful rivals for the
handsome actor's love&mdash;Alpine Belmont in one box with
her haughty mother, and in the other Kathleen Carew,
chaperoned by Mrs. Stone and with Teddy Darrell hanging
adoringly over her chair.</p>

<p>Kathleen was all in white&mdash;a simple form of mourning&mdash;and
white flowers, set off by their own green leaves,
were her only adorning.</p>

<p>And Teddy Darrell? Well, the young swell "was gotten
up regardless," as one of his friends remarked&mdash;"a
golden youth" like himself. His evening dress was
faultless, and his button-hole bouquet matched Kathleen's
white flowers. His diamonds were magnificent, and his
whole air was so hopeful and exuberant that when Ralph
Chainey from the stage first caught sight of him his
heart sunk with despair. He felt that "flirting Teddy"
was a rival to be dreaded.</p>

<p>"Why need she have come to torture me with the sight
of all I have lost?" he thought, despairingly; but he went
on splendidly with his part in the play. A stubborn
pride came to his aid. She should not see how he was
suffering, this lovely, scornful girl leaning back in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
chair to look up into the handsome face so close to her
own as attentive Teddy wielded the white ostrich feather
fan. She scarcely seemed to see what went on upon the
stage; she did not look across into the box where her
step-mother and Alpine were staring in angry surprise.
She looked only at Teddy Darrell; she smiled only at
him. It was such a pronounced flirtation that the crowded
house observed it and smiled indulgently at the handsome
pair, declaring that it would certainly be a match.</p>

<p>Whispers, too, were circulating among the people who
had known Kathleen Carew in her life-time. Who was
this girl with the face and smile of the dead heiress?&mdash;that
luring face so subtly beautiful that no one had
dreamed the world could hold a copy.</p>

<p>Curiosity moved a gentleman, when the curtain fell, to
go and ask Mrs. Carew about it.</p>

<p>"I am as much amazed as you are," she replied.</p>

<p>"Then you can not tell me who she is," he said, regretfully.</p>

<p>"She is masquerading under the name of my dead step-daughter,
and pretends to be resurrected from a trance,
or something like that. We first heard about it yesterday,"
was Mrs. Carew's curt reply.</p>

<p>"Then you have not seen her until to-night?"</p>

<p>"No," nervously.</p>

<p>"Shall you acknowledge her, Mrs. Carew?"</p>

<p>"No. She is an impostor, and we will have nothing
to do with the minx."</p>

<p>"Speak for yourself, mamma," said Alpine, pertly.
"I'm not sure she's an impostor, for it is Kathleen's
face and her very gestures. I am going over to Mrs.
Stone's box and find out the truth for myself, if Mr.
Layne will take me."</p>

<p>She rose, drawing the blue wrap about her white
shoulders. Mrs. Carew stared aghast.</p>

<p>"You will not, you <i>must</i> not!" she exclaimed, angrily.</p>

<p>Alpine bent down and whispered rapidly in her ear:</p>

<p>"What does it matter? I have her money safe; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
could not get it if she lived a thousand years, and I
have my own plans. You must not interfere with them."</p>

<p>When Alpine took that tone, her mother knew that protest
was useless.</p>

<p>"Do as you please," she muttered, angrily, and tossed
her head as Alpine went out leaning on Mr. Layne's arm.</p>

<p>"What is the girl up to, I wonder?" she mused, uneasily.
"She always had a sneaking fondness for Kathleen,
and would be just silly enough to bring her home
to live with us. She shall not do it, no matter what the
world says. I always hated the girl for the look she has
of her dead mother."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carew was jealous of the very memory of poor
Zaidee, and could not bear the sight of her beautiful
daughter. She writhed with anger when she saw Alpine
embrace Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Kathleen, is it really you? Oh, you darling, let me
kiss you!" she cried, effusively, and put her arms impulsively
about the young girl.</p>

<p>Kathleen recoiled from her at first. She thought that
Alpine knew all about her mother's cruelty; but as Alpine
held her in that warm embrace, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Kathleen, why did you not come home to us?"</p>

<p>Kathleen released herself from Alpine, answering, bitterly:</p>

<p>"I came, but your mother denied me, and put me out
into the street, unconscious, to perish in the snow."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" cried Alpine. But there came to her all
in a rush the memory of that night when her mother had
told her that a woman had come to see Ivan, and she
had driven her away.</p>

<p>"She deceived me; it was Kathleen," she thought, and
exclaimed, eagerly:</p>

<p>"My dearest girl, she did not tell me anything about
it, but of course she believed you were an impostor. You
believe me? you will let me be your friend, Kathleen?"
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Come and see me at Mrs. Stone's to-morrow, Alpine,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
her step-sister answered; and then turned to the gentleman.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mr. Layne? Will you, too, take me
for an impostor?" she inquired, holding out her little
hand to him.</p>

<p>"No, indeed, Miss Carew, for I am sure there can not
be a copy of your beautiful face in all the world," he replied,
gallantly. Being an elderly widower, he felt privileged
to pay broad compliments.</p>

<p>Kathleen blushed and smiled, and the curtain rising at
that moment showed Ralph Chainey that Alpine had
seized the first opportunity to go and see Kathleen.</p>

<p>He was intensely pleased with Alpine's loyalty.</p>

<p>"She is a better girl than I used to think," he decided,
and made up his mind to go to her box the first opportunity
to thank her for her goodness.</p>

<p>He did not dream that Alpine was whispering at that
moment little poisoned arrows into Kathleen's ear about
himself, nor of the cruel pain that tore Kathleen's heart
as she heard of her lover's liking for Alpine.</p>

<p>"When he came yesterday, he told me of your being
at Mrs. Stone's. What a shock it was to know you were
really living! But I must go back to mamma now, and
to-morrow I'll come and see you, and hear all about
your little romance," tearing herself away.</p>

<p>Just as she expected, Ralph hurried to her box as soon
as the curtain fell.</p>

<p>"What did she say?" he whispered, eagerly; and Kathleen,
who was watching them, felt her heart thrill with
renewed bitterness as she saw the curly brown head bent
low over Alpine's straw-gold one.</p>

<p>"He is doing it to pique me," she thought; but she
could not turn her burning dark eyes away from the
sight.</p>

<p>Alpine looked up smilingly into the pale, anxious face.</p>

<p>"She told me to come to-morrow and see her and hear
her story; there was not time to-night," she replied.</p>

<p>He was disappointed; she read it in his speaking
countenance, and added:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>"She gave me one bit of news, but I am not sure that
I ought to tell you."</p>

<p>"Please do so," he urged.</p>

<p>"It will pain you, I fear," sighed Alpine.</p>

<p>"I am strong enough to bear anything except&mdash;suspense,"
setting his teeth firmly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carew was looking at them curiously:</p>

<p>"Mamma, will you please excuse us for whispering?
I have something to tell Mr. Chainey&mdash;a secret."</p>

<p>"You are excusable," the lady replied, sourly, turning
away her head.</p>

<p>Alpine whispered to Ralph:</p>

<p>"Kathleen is engaged to be married to Teddy Darrell,
and is the happiest girl I ever saw!"</p>

<p>He was silent a moment, then murmured, bitterly:</p>

<p>"She has no heart! How could she turn so quickly
from one love to another?"</p>

<p>"She is fickle as the wind," Alpine answered, with a
contemptuous shrug.</p>

<p>Alpine had come and gone. Under a mask of sweetness
and love, she had tortured Kathleen's heart.</p>

<p>"My dear girl, how fortunate you are to have caught
Teddy Darrell!" she exclaimed, after Kathleen had told
her the story of her adventures, save and excepting about
Fedora's claim that she was Ralph Chainey's wife. That
one dread secret the girl kept locked close in her heart.</p>

<p>"Fortunate!" Kathleen echoed, dully.</p>

<p>"Yes," Alpine answered. "He is rich, and unless you
are going to marry him, it does not look well for you to
remain with Mrs. Stone."</p>

<p>"But, Alpine, I have no other place to go. Mrs. Stone

<p>"But I do not love him, Alpine. I&mdash;I loved Ralph
Chainey&mdash;once&mdash;so dearly that I feel that I can never
love another."</p>

<p>"Why have you turned against Ralph?" asked her
step-sister, curiously.</p>

<p>"I can not tell you," faltered Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Do you love him still?"</p>

<p>"No," Kathleen answered, spiritedly; but Alpine did
not believe one word.</p>

<p>"Kathleen, how would you like to come back home?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Your mother would not permit it," sighed the young
girl.</p>

<p>"It is because she does not believe you are really Kathleen.
She thinks you an impostor. I have been talking
to her, trying to get her consent to bring you home."</p>

<p>Kathleen looked curiously at her step-sister, puzzled by
her odd air of hesitancy.</p>

<p>"Well, go on. What is it?" she asked, with that little
imperious manner inseparable from herself.</p>

<p>"She would not agree except on one condition."</p>

<p>Kathleen looked at her in silent wonder, and, with pretended
sorrow, Alpine said:</p>

<p>"The condition was that you come as a housemaid&mdash;as
a paid servant."</p>

<p>She saw, with silent, secret malice, the angry crimson
mount to Kathleen's pearly cheek, and remained silent a
few moments to enjoy the sensation of proud Kathleen
humiliated.</p>

<p>Kathleen was indeed furious with resentment, and for
a moment she could not speak for the great lump in her
throat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she fought down her emotion with an iron will
and looked straight at her tormentor, saying, coolly:</p>

<p>"I suppose it is so hard for your mother to forget the
position she once occupied in my father's house that she
would be glad to sink his daughter to the same level."</p>

<p>Alpine crimsoned. She always hated to remember that
her mother had been Zaidee Carew's governess, and that
it was hinted that her arts had driven the artless child-wife
to despair and death.</p>

<p>But it was not her policy to seem offended with Kathleen.
To propitiate Ralph Chainey, she must still seem
to be the friend of the girl he loved so dearly.</p>

<p>So she looked at her lovely rival with a sad, sweet
smile, and said:</p>

<p>"Of course, I knew that you would not come&mdash;that
way&mdash;and I told mamma so. But she made me promise
to tell you what she said. You must not be angry with
me, dear, for I have a better plan for you."</p>

<p>The young girl looked at her in angry silence, asking
herself: "What new insult?"</p>

<p>"You know, of course, that your father, in a fit of
anger against you, left me all his money in a will?" asked
Alpine.</p>

<p>Kathleen nodded coldly.</p>

<p>"I am going to make you an allowance to live on, Kathleen.
I told mamma I meant to do so, and she said your
father did not intend for you to have a penny of that
money. Of course, I knew that. But it makes no difference
to me, for I can not bear to have you living on
Mrs. Stone's charity. It is better for you to depend on
me for your support than on a stranger. Don't you think
so yourself?"</p>

<p>Kathleen rose up, white-faced, indignant, goaded to
fury.</p>

<p>"No, I do not think so," she said, angrily. "I would
rather starve in the streets than support life on an allowance
from you, made out of the money that should
be mine, but which you cheated me out of by some cunning
trick known only to yourself and your mother. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
believe you are deceitful, that you are only pretending a
kind feeling for me to serve some purpose of your own.
Go, go, and leave me to myself and my misery!"</p>

<p>There was something in the looks and words of that
frail, beautiful young girl that compelled obedience from
Alpine. She rose instantly.</p>

<p>"Well, good-bye, since you will not let me be your
friend," she said, and glided from the room.</p>

<p>Kathleen walked up and down the floor in a passion of
insulted pride, her cheeks burning, her little fists clinched
in impotent wrath, her heart on fire with the longing to
avenge herself on those two insolent women.</p>

<p>It was a dangerous time to her for Teddy Darrell to
enter&mdash;handsome, loving Teddy who adored her, and who
was wild with anger over the insult she had received;
for Kathleen could not keep back her grievance; she told
Teddy frankly of Mrs. Carew's message and of Alpine's
offer.</p>

<p>"Great Heaven! how mean some women can be! It
was done purposely to humiliate you!" he exclaimed,
angrily.</p>

<p>He looked at beautiful Kathleen, with the fire of her
dark eyes dim with tears, and her cheeks burning with
resentment, feeling himself hardly able to refrain from
taking her in his arms and kissing away the tempestuous
tears.</p>

<p>Suddenly his repressed passion burst forth:</p>

<p>"Kathleen, my darling, do marry me! Can't you learn
to love me just a little? I would be so fond of you, so
devoted, that you could not help but learn to love me.
And I am rich, you know. I would help you queen it
over those insolent women."</p>

<p>Her heart leaped at his words; pride carried the day.</p>

<p>"I would do it&mdash;if&mdash;if&mdash;I&mdash;thought I <i>could</i> learn to
love you; and that ought to be easy, because you have
been so good to me, and I am so grateful," she murmured.</p>

<p>It did seem easy at the moment. Teddy was true,
Teddy loved her, while Ralph Chainey was false and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
cruel. Why should she wear the willow for <i>him</i>? Why
lie down in the dust, while her heartless step-mother and
step-sister trampled on her rights and her feelings? So
in a fury of resentment, Kathleen gave Teddy her promise
to marry him and to learn to love him.</p>

<p class="center">RALPH CHAINEY IS DRIVEN TO DESPERATION, AND TURNS
ON HIS FOE.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Even now, I tell you, I wonder<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whether this woman called Estelle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is flesh and blood, or a beautiful lie<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sent up from the depths of hell.<br /></span>
<span class="i18"><span class="smcap">Edmund Clarence Stedman</span>.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Ralph Chainey went from Alpine's presence to his
home in Sumner, one of the beautiful suburbs of Boston,
and to the presence of his gentle widowed mother, who
presided over a lovely home that was shared with her
by an older son and his small family.</p>

<p>"Ralph, dear, you look pale. You are ill!" she exclaimed,
anxiously.</p>

<p>"My head aches severely. I will go to my room and
lie down for an hour to get my nerves steady for to-night,"
he said; and kissing her affectionately he left her
to seek seclusion for his aching heart and brain.</p>

<p>He leaned his aching head on his hand, and a rush of
bitter memories swept over him.</p>

<p>He saw himself five years ago a boy of twenty-two,
brilliant, ardent, and impetuous, just beginning his dramatic
career. At the very outset he had fallen into the
toils of a beautiful actress years older than himself. By
a clever playing of her cards, she had entrapped him into
a marriage; but scarcely had the honey-moon waned ere
he learned to his horror the true character of his wife.
She was false, light, and wicked, and no entreaties could
win her from her wicked ways.</p>

<p>A separation ensued, and Ralph, ashamed to court publicity
by applying for a divorce, agreed to support the
false woman if she would promise not to annoy him by
venturing into his presence. She accepted these terms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
but instead of retiring to seclusion, as he desired her,
Fedora, as she called herself, joined a ballet troupe, and
scandalized her unfortunate young husband by her wild
career. Still the marriage was wholly unknown to the
world, and in hopes of maintaining this silence, the young
actor suffered on patiently, his pride wounded, his fancy
dead, his soul thrilled with disgust, but one solace left to
him, and that the knowledge that his false wife had kept
faith with him in preserving his secret&mdash;kept faith because
he had threatened her with exposure and divorce upon
its betrayal.</p>

<p>At last she had broken faith, and, bitterest of all, had
betrayed his miserable folly to the one woman that he
wished never to know it&mdash;to beautiful, proud Kathleen,
the idol of his very soul, for whom he had felt all the
passion of the poet's plaint:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I love you. That is all. Life holds no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Here in your arms I have no other world.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where is the mad ambition known of yore?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">All fled away to some far-distant shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And lost forever. Yes, I love you, sweet&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">You only&mdash;you alone. My heart, my life<br /></span>
<span class="i3">I lay&mdash;a meager offering&mdash;at your feet."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It had fallen on him like a crushing blow, the knowledge
that Fedora lived, when he had been duped, deceived
into believing that she was dead and he was free.</p>

<p>A telegraphic message from Richmond, where she had
been playing, had summoned him to her death-bed; but
when he reached the city her friends told him she was
dead and buried.</p>

<p>They showed him a new grave in the beautiful shades
of romantic Hollywood, and presented him with a long
bill for her funeral expenses. He paid it without a murmur,
and could not help feeling glad that he was rid of
his terrible incubus. He did not dream that it was only
a clever plot of the wicked woman to extort money, and
that she enjoyed very much the liberal sum he had handed
over to liquidate the expenses of her interment.</p>

<p>He realized it all now&mdash;saw how cruelly Fate, in the
shape of the heartless Fedora, had used him, and, with
a bitter groan, stared his cruel destiny in the face.</p>

<p>Fedora&mdash;his false wife&mdash;lived! She had parted him
forever from his beautiful, dark-eyed love.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We have parted&mdash;I have loved thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">But for me all hope is o'er!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We have parted, and forever;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">I must dream of thee no more!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He believed that Kathleen was going to marry Teddy
Darrell, as Alpine hinted, but he was not so sure that it
was for love. He remembered, with a thrill of blended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
rapture and despair, how he had caught Kathleen to his
heart this morning, and how she had lain passive in his
arms at first.</p>

<p>"She did not repulse me at first," he thought. "Her
heart throbbed wildly against mine, and she lay yielding
and passive in the utter <i>abandon</i> of a pure woman who
truly loves. Then she <i>remembered</i> all at once, and
withdrew herself from me in stinging scorn."</p>

<p>He groaned bitterly at the memory of her cruel words.</p>

<p>"My poor, proud darling! if she would but have listened
to me, she might have pitied and forgiven me," he
thought, with the fluctuating hopes of a lover's heart. He
loved Kathleen so dearly that he could not remain angry
with her, although he tried to do so. In his heart he made
excuses for her. She was so young, so inexperienced,
and there was no telling what lies Fedora had told the
young girl.</p>

<p>"I will punish that fiend, at least," he cried, starting
to his feet. "No more squeamishness shall deter me from
seeking a divorce, and I shall do so at once. Who knows
but that Kathleen may pity me, may relent, when she
learns all that I have suffered?"</p>

<span class="i26"><span class="smcap">E. W. Wilcox</span>.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Mrs. Stone was charmed when she heard that Kathleen
was to marry Teddy.</p>

<p>"You will be as happy as the day is long!" she exclaimed,
fondly kissing the beautiful girl.</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" asked Kathleen, anxiously.</p>

<p>Proud as she was, she began to feel frightened at what
she had done.</p>

<p>She found her wayward heart going out in a passion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
regret after her lost lover, instead of leaning fondly on
her accepted one.</p>

<p>She was alarmed lest it should always be so, and so
she timidly asked the question of Mrs. Stone:</p>

<p>"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Stone did not know anything of that lost lover&mdash;did
not guess at the pain in the young girl's heart.</p>

<p>She honestly believed that, given a fair opportunity,
her cousin might win this girl's pure young heart.</p>

<p>So she encouraged Kathleen to look forward with
pleasure to her marriage.</p>

<p>"And I should let it be soon," she said. "Teddy
wishes it very, very much, and has begged me to plead
his cause."</p>

<p>"Oh, not soon!" cried the young girl, in alarm.</p>

<p>"Why not, my dear? As well one time as another,
if you mean to marry him at all."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I want to wait until Helen Fox comes home. She
always promised to be my bride-maid."</p>

<p>"You can write to Helen. It will take a few weeks
to get your <i>trousseau</i> ready, and by then she can come
home."</p>

<p>The big, dark eyes were dilated with terror.</p>

<p>"I should not like to <i>hurry</i> Helen home. I want&mdash;want&mdash;her&mdash;to
enjoy her trip as long as she likes," faltered
Kathleen, piteously.</p>

<p>"You dear, timid child! you are determined to make
Teddy wait for his happiness," laughed her friend.
"Well, never mind: let it be as long as you choose. Only
you will not mind if I begin to get your <i>trousseau</i> ready?
You know there are always so many delays."</p>

<p>A burning blush stole over Kathleen's pure cheek.</p>

<p>"Dear Mrs. Stone, Teddy will have to take me as I
am. I have no money for a <i>trousseau</i>," she sighed.</p>

<p>"Let that be my care. Surely I may make a wedding
gift to my cousin's bride!"</p>

<p>"Let it be as simple as possible, then, dear Mrs.
Stone," answered proud Kathleen.</p>

<p>But that night she thought of the necklace she had left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
with Golden &amp; Glitter. It was worth five thousand
dollars, and they had advanced her one thousand on it.
Perhaps they would let her have more&mdash;enough to buy
her simple wedding garments, and save her the humiliation
of accepting them from Mrs. Stone.</p>

<p>She was not afraid of startling them. The story of her
return had leaked out; the Boston papers had given it
publicity. So she went in Mrs. Stone's carriage the next
morning to the great jewelers, and was received by them
with the greatest affability. They overwhelmed her with
congratulations on her resurrection. But when she asked
about her diamond necklace they told her an amazing
story. Ivan Belmont had come to them soon after her
supposed death, and redeemed the necklace by the payment
of a thousand dollars, acting, he claimed, under the
instructions of his mother.</p>

<p>Kathleen gazed at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>"But I never told any human being about selling the
diamonds! How could they know?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>The jewelers were as much puzzled as she was. They
had told no one, either, but were intending to acquaint
Mrs. Carew with the truth, when Ivan Belmont had forestalled
them by presenting himself and redeeming the
necklace.</p>

<p>They advised the young girl to go to Mrs. Carew and
demand the return of the jewels. They did not doubt
that she would be glad to return them to the hapless girl
they had stripped of everything.</p>

<p>Kathleen's eyes were flashing with anger. She passionately
gave the order to drive to Commonwealth Avenue,
determined to demand her rights.</p>

<p>When Jones opened the door to the imperious young
beauty his face lighted with instant recognition and he
rejoiced to see that she had survived the horrors of that
dreadful night when Mrs. Carew had cast her forth to
die.</p>

<p>But he remembered the orders of his mistress, and
firmly barred her entrance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mrs. Carew's orders was not to admit you, miss, if
you came again," he said, resolutely.</p>

<p>"How dare she!" exclaimed Kathleen, her eyes flashing.</p>

<p>"But, really, miss, you know 'tain't right for you to
follow Mr. Belmont right into his mother's house," remonstrated
Jones, uneasily; and as she stared at him, he
added, coaxingly: "You better go wait down there at the
corner while I go tell Mr. Belmont that you want him."</p>

<p>"Why, what do you mean?" inquired Kathleen,
sharply.</p>

<p>"Why, ain't you Ivan Belmont's&mdash;sweetheart, miss?"</p>

<p>"How dare you?" cried the girl.</p>

<p>The lightnings of her eyes seemed almost to scorch him,
and he faltered:</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you asked for him that night when you came
before; and Mrs. Carew&mdash;begging your pardon, miss&mdash;said
you were <i>bad</i>, and told me to take you and throw you
in the street."</p>

<p>"So it was you that did it?" the girl cried, sharply.</p>

<p>"No, miss. I could not have treated a dog like that,"
whispered Jones, glancing over his shoulder, lest he be
overheard. Then he told her how much he had pitied
her, and how he had placed her in the carriage, hoping
some one would care for her.</p>

<p>"God bless you for your pity!" cried the girl, melted
almost to tears; and, in her turn, she told Jones who she
really was, and that when she had asked him for his master
that night, she had meant her father, not knowing that
he was dead.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Carew told you a willful falsehood," she said,
angrily; then paused, remembering that it was not dignified
to discuss her step-mother with a servant, no matter
how great the provocation.</p>

<p>"And you must really let me come in, because I have important
business with your mistress. If she discharges
you for permitting me to enter, I will get my friends to
procure you another situation," she added, kindly.</p>

<p>The man stood aside in respectful assent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you kindly, Miss Carew. You will find my
mistress with her son and daughter in the library," he
said.</p>

<p>"So <i>he</i> is here. So much the better," thought Kathleen.</p>

<p>She swept, with an aching heart, down the superb hall
of her old home, Jones gazing after her in respectful admiration.</p>

<p>"My! what a high-stepping beauty! A regular goddess!"
he ejaculated; and breathed a silent prayer that the
disinherited daughter might yet oust these heartless people
out of her old home and come into her own.</p>

<p>Kathleen, pale with passion, flung back the library
curtains with a shaking hand, and stood revealed to the
inmates.</p>

<p>Ivan Belmont had read with horror in a distant city the
marvelous story of his step-sister's resurrection and return.
Trembling with fear, he recalled the night when he
had encountered her upon the steps and fled away from
her, believing she was a ghost.</p>

<p>He had come home to find out the truth, and was even
now listening to the story, as told by his mother and sister,
when the curtains parted, flung back by an angry
hand, and Kathleen, beautiful and imperious in her righteous
wrath, stood revealed to their astonished eyes.</p>

<p>A gasp of astonishment, and Mrs. Carew rose, tall,
stately, insolent.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this intrusion?" she demanded.
"I told Jones that he was not to admit the likes
of you to this house!"</p>

<p>Kathleen's lightning glance almost transfixed her, and
she flushed with sudden uneasiness.</p>

<p>"I came here for my diamonds. Give them to me, and
I will go," the young girl answered, defiantly, and she
saw Ivan Belmont whiten to a deadly pallor.</p>

<p>"Diamonds?" echoed Alpine, in surprise.</p>

<p>"I have just come from Golden &amp; Glitter's," said
Kathleen. "I went there for my diamond necklace that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
left there as security for a thousand dollars when I went
away. They told me that Ivan Belmont had redeemed the
necklace for his mother."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Those lips are thine&mdash;thy own sweet smile I see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same that oft in childhood solaced me.<br /></span>
<span class="i26"><span class="smcap">Cowper</span>.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Kathleen's declaration was almost equal to the bursting
of a bomb-shell in the handsome library of the Carew
mansion.</p>

<p>Alpine sprung excitedly to her feet with a scream of
surprise, and fixed her dilated blue eyes almost wildly
upon Kathleen's pale, angry face.</p>

<p>Her mother, who was so crafty and wicked that one
could scarcely charge her with any meanness of which
she was not guilty, had the novel sensation of being
falsely accused for once, and recoiled with a nasty and
indignant disclaimer from her insolent and threatening
position toward the intruder.</p>

<p>"Your accusation is entirely false!" she cried,
hoarsely.</p>

<p>But it was upon her dissipated son that Kathleen's
words fell with the most crushing power.</p>

<p>This slender, handsome Ivan Belmont, with his straw-gold
curls and seraphic blue eyes, was a cold and brutal
villain who utterly belied his gentle looks. He had all
his mother's evil traits intensified, and would not stop
at murder if there was anything to be gained by it, provided
he was not to be found out. He was a coward,
and afraid of punishment.</p>

<p>So when Kathleen made her bold charge against him,
and he realized that possible detection and punishment
hung over his head, his coward heart gave a thump as if
it would burst the confines of his narrow chest, his brain
reeled, his fair face whitened to an ashy hue, his limbs
trembled beneath him as he clutched the back of a chair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
and with an inarticulate groan of feeble denial, he sunk
in a senseless heap upon the floor.</p>

<p>"Ivan is dead! You have killed him with your false
words!" shrieked Alpine, running to her brother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carew followed, and they knelt down over Ivan,
exclaiming and lamenting, although much of it was for
effect, for they did not waste much affection on their
black sheep.</p>

<p>Kathleen, readily comprehending that Ivan had fainted
from terror, curled a scornful lip, and turning her back
on them, walked across the room to where a life-size
portrait of her dead father filled a panel near his writing-desk.</p>

<p>Vincent Carew had been a singularly handsome and
imposing gentleman, and the fine artist had done full
justice to his noble subject. The dark eyes seemed to
hold the very fire of life and the smiling lips almost about
to breathe a blessing on his wronged, unhappy orphan
child.</p>

<p>As Kathleen paused in front of the magnificent portrait
of her lost father, the hard, defiant look on her face
faded as if by magic, and the burning light of her large
Oriental dark eyes was softened by a rush of tears. Almost
unconsciously she sunk upon her knees and lifted
her clasped white hands appealingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, father, dear father, if only you could speak to
me, if only you could tell me why you turned against
your unhappy child?" she sighed, pathetically.</p>

<p>It was a sorrowful picture&mdash;pathetic enough to move
anything but the heart of a fiend&mdash;that unhappy girl
kneeling there in tears and love before the portrait of
the father who had disinherited her and left her to want
and misery.</p>

<p>But no one noticed her. Mrs. Carew and her daughter
were busy over Ivan, whose swoon was a deep one.
Kathleen's raining tears fell unnoticed and unpitied, save
by the great All-seeing Eye.</p>

<p>Kathleen's heart was thrilling with all the pathos expressed
in Cowper's beautiful lines:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, that those lips had language! Life has passed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With me but roughly since I heard thee last!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Alas! how cruel it was to think that this dear, loving
father had turned against her at the last! What was the
mystery of it? Who was to blame?</p>

<p>"Not you, papa darling!" moaned the girl, loyal to her
love for him despite everything. "Some one deceived
you, lied to you, made you believe me unworthy of your
love. I will not lay it up against you. I forgive you,
dear, because you were always so good and loving!" her
voice broke in a hard sob, ending with, "But, oh, papa,
papa, I wish you could come back from the grave as I
did, to comfort your poor girl! Dear Lord, I pray Thee
send papa back to me!"</p>

<p>Had Heaven answered her earnest prayer?</p>

<p>She turned wildly toward the door, for a strange voice
had sounded from it&mdash;strange, yet not strange, for it had
a tone of her father's voice in it, although louder and less
refined than Vincent Carew's polished tones.</p>

<p>A stranger had entered the library&mdash;a tall old man in
shabby genteel clothes that had seen much service, and
wearing a long gray beard that matched his bushy gray
curls. A pair of smoky glasses hid a pair of dark eyes
that twinkled with curiosity as he advanced, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Hey-day, good friends! what's the matter with the
pretty young man? Sick?"</p>

<p>Ivan Belmont had at that moment opened his light-blue
eyes on the faces of his mother and sister, and they
turned languidly on the new-comer, while Mrs. Carew
exclaimed, almost ferociously, her eyes gleaming like blue
steel:</p>

<p>"Who are you, and what is the meaning of this intrusion?"</p>

<p>"My name is Ben Carew, at your service, Sister
Carew. Howdy&mdash;howdy do, all of you? These your
children? Is your son sick much?" replied the stranger,
in a loud, familiar tone.</p>

<p>"Impertinent!" muttered the lady, angrily. She rose
to her feet. "See here, old man, you have made a mistake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
coming here, certainly. I don't know you, and have
no business with you, so clear out at once!"</p>

<p>The old man stood his ground, undismayed by the
virago.</p>

<p>"Not so fast, ma'am, not so fast," he said, soothingly,
with a wave of his hand. "Now, ain't you Vincent
Carew's widow?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she snapped.</p>

<p>"And I'm Vincent Carew's brother Ben."</p>

<p>Every eye in the room turned on him in amazement,
and Mrs. Carew exclaimed:</p>

<p>"My husband did not have a brother at all!"</p>

<p>"No brother that he owned, maybe, but an older
brother, for all that, living down on the farm, poor and
humble, so maybe his proud, ambitious brother didn't
own up to his folks about Ben; but all the same he was
good to him, and many's the year Vince sent money
down to the old farm to help out when the crops failed
and prices fell on live stock&mdash;many's the day, God rest
his soul!"</p>

<p>Brother Ben drew his hand across his eyes and the
sound of suppressed sobs filled the room.</p>

<p>"My husband is dead, if he was any relation to you;
so we don't want you here," Mrs. Carew said to him,
brutally.</p>

<p>He started back as if she had struck him, and said,
sadly:</p>

<p>"Yes, I heard that he was dead, and I wished it had
been me instead. I ain't much 'count in the world, no-how;
but the neighbors said: 'Ben, you ought to go up
to Boston and get your share of your brother's property.'
Vince left me something, I know. He always said
he would without my ever asking."</p>

<p>"He left you nothing. I don't believe in you, anyway.
You're an impostor, I'm sure. So get out of this
at once!" insisted Mrs. Carew. But he did not stir.</p>

<p>"I want to stay and visit you, sister-in-law, and see the
city sights," he pleaded.</p>

<p>"Go; I won't have you here! You are a disgrace to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
the house!" she said, angrily, but still inwardly appalled,
for, in spite of his rough looks and country manners, he
was wonderfully like the dead brother he claimed. In
voice, features, and gesture he recalled the dead.</p>

<p>He stood staring in pained amazement at the inhospitable
woman, when suddenly a little hand stole into his,
and a tearful voice murmured:</p>

<p>"Uncle Ben, I believe in you and I love you, for you
are so like my dear, dead papa that it makes my heart
glad just to see and hear you."</p>

<p>He looked down into the face of a lovely, dark-eyed
girl, whose lips were trembling with a hushed sob, and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Why, this is Vince's girl. I know by the favor!
God bless you, honey! give your old uncle a hug;" and
he put his honest arms around her, and pressed the curly
golden head against his breast.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see such impudence, mamma? Kathleen
is utterly shameless!" cried Alpine, in a high key
of disdain.</p>

<p>"You'll let me stay, won't you, sissy, dear? I'm too
old to travel straight back to the country," said Uncle
Ben, coaxingly, while he turned a glance of meek pleasure
and triumph on the others.</p>

<p>"Alas! dear uncle, this is not my home. I can not
invite you to remain, much as I wish to do so," sighed the
young girl.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben Carew stared in surprise at his niece when
she made her strange declaration; but she continued,
sadly:</p>

<p>"Uncle Ben, you must not blame papa for his seeming
cruelty to you and me when I tell you all. But&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
dear papa, when he died, disinherited me, and left his
wealth to these two heartless women here."</p>

<p>"Good land! my child, what had you done to turn
Vince against you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, dear uncle! but I believe that cunning arts
were employed by some other people to turn my father's
heart against his child," answered Kathleen, spiritedly.</p>

<p>"Mamma, will you permit Kathleen to belittle us in
our very presence, and in our own house?" exclaimed
Alpine, angrily.</p>

<p>Kathleen looked at her step-sister, who stood at the
back of the chair into which she had assisted the pale
and trembling Ivan.</p>

<p>"I have no desire to remain in your house a moment
longer than is necessary," she said, proudly. "I am going
at once, and I will take my uncle with me as a guest in
my friend's house. But before I go, Mrs. Carew, please
give me my diamond necklace."</p>

<p>"There is some mistake. I know nothing about your
diamonds. I did not take them from the jewellers," answered
Mrs. Carew, angrily; but there was such a ring
of truth in her voice that Kathleen believed her for
once.</p>

<p>She turned to Alpine.</p>

<p>"Perhaps <i>you</i> have the diamonds?" she said, interrogatively.</p>

<p>"I have <i>not</i>. I thought you took them with you when
you went away, and that they were stolen from you when
you were robbed that night," answered Alpine, earnestly.</p>

<p>"I believe you," said Kathleen, and her burning glance
fell on Ivan Belmont as he cowered before her in his seat.</p>

<p>"It is you," she said, shaking a disdainful finger in his
face; "it is you to whom I must look for my jewels!
Where are they? What have you done with them?"</p>

<p>He tried hard to stammer a weak denial of all knowledge
of them, but even his own mother and sister knew
that he was lying. Kathleen's great flashing eyes surveyed
him in bitter scorn.</p>

<p>"Do not deny it&mdash;I can see that you are speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
falsely," she said. "You can not deny it in the face of
the jewelers' assertion. Perhaps you have sold them to
get money to go on with your dissipated habits. Listen:
I will give you one week in which to return the diamonds,
or four thousand dollars in lieu of them." She paused,
and he muttered another disclaimer, but Kathleen persisted:
"I can not afford to lose the small fortune that is
all that remains to me of my father's gifts for a scruple of
pity to those who have been pitiless to me. So unless you
return the jewels or their value in a week's time, I shall
hand you over to the law."</p>

<p>With a heightened color she took the old man's arm.</p>

<p>"Come, Uncle Ben, let us go," she said, and swept
from the room with the air of a dethroned princess, Uncle
Ben following humbly in her wake.</p>

<p>Jones let her out with an air of distinct approval, having
hovered near the library door and heard all that transpired
within.</p>

<p>Kathleen, going down the steps with her shabby, newly
found relative, came face to face with a man going up&mdash;Ralph
Chainey. A start on either side, a cold, stiff bow,
then Kathleen stepped into the carriage and sunk half-fainting
against the cushions.</p>

<p>"Who was that, my dear?" inquired her uncle, observing
her agitation.</p>

<p>Kathleen stifled a sob, and answered:</p>

<p>"It was Ralph Chainey, the great actor."</p>

<p>"Um-hum! I have heard of him. But what made
you feel so bad at seeing him, honey?"</p>

<p>"Oh! uncle, I used to love him, and expected to marry
him; but, alas! that is all over now," sighed the young
girl; and there came into her mind some of the words of
Laura Jean Libbey's sweet, sad song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Lovers once, but strangers now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though pledged by many a tender vow;<br /></span>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>
<p>She leaned her bright head lovingly against the old
man's kindly shoulder and sobbed out all the pain in her
heart.</p>

<p>"Tell me all about it, dearie," said the old farmer,
gently.</p>

<p>But Kathleen's heart was too full. The sight of her
handsome, perjured lover, fascinating Ralph Chainey,
was too much for her. Her tears flowed unrestrainedly
until Mrs. Stone's house was reached.</p>

<p>But here Kathleen's uncle decidedly declined her invitation
to enter.</p>

<p>"No, honey; not just now. I'm shabby looking by the
side of fine city folks, and I'll go and buy me some better
clothes&mdash;a new hat and a white shirt&mdash;then to-morrow I'll
come back here and see your friend and yourself," he replied,
and left her at the door.</p>

<p>Kathleen told her friend all about the morning's events,
and received her very sincere sympathy.</p>

<p>"I always felt that those Carews were mean, especially
Ivan," she said. "But, never mind, dearie. When your
uncle comes to-morrow we will make him remain for a
long visit."</p>

<p class="center">RALPH'S LETTER.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The world is naught when one is gone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who was the world; then the heart breaks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That this is lost which once was won.<br /></span>
<span class="i26"><span class="smcap">Arlo Bates</span>.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>But before the old gentleman called in the morning,
Kathleen had a great shock of surprise.</p>

<p>The morning papers had not had anything so exciting
to chronicle for a long time as the news that Ralph
Chainey, the great actor, and the idol of the hour, had
been secretly married to a beautiful ballet dancer who was
no better than she ought to be, and that he had publicly
applied for a legal divorce to free him from his galling
fetters.</p>

<p>Of course the public had to know all about it, so the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
reporters had besieged Ralph Chainey, and he had talked
freely with them, giving them all his sad story, hoping in
this way to reach the obdurate heart of beautiful Kathleen.</p>

<p>Surely, he thought, when she heard his story aright&mdash;when
she heard how cruelly he had been betrayed by the
false and wicked Fedora&mdash;she must pity and pardon her
unhappy lover.</p>

<p>Ralph Chainey was not much of a praying man, but in
these hours of awful suspense his thoughts took almost
the form of a prayer to God that He would help him to
win his proud young love who had scorned him in such
disdainful fashion.</p>

<p>So he told the reporters his sad story in his most eloquent
fashion, and they reproduced it in glowing paragraphs,
denouncing Fedora in unmeasured terms for her
sins and her hypocrisy, and hinting at the beautiful love
affair that had been broken off by Fedora's resurrection
from the grave in which her young husband believed her
resting. They did not tell the name of the actor's beautiful
young love, because Ralph Chainey had been very
careful not to tell them; but they dwelt eloquently on the
actor's love for her, and his hope that, in the event of
his securing a divorce, she would become his worshiped
wife.</p>

<p>Kathleen read this moving story with heaving bosom
and dilated eyes, and while she was yet reading it, the
bell rang and a package was handed in for her with a
letter.</p>

<p>Ralph Chainey&mdash;forgetting, like any true lover, his
pride in his love&mdash;had sent to Kathleen marked copies
of the morning papers and some brief, pathetic lines.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Oh, my lost love," ran the note, "will you not read, and
reading, pity and forgive me, the story of my sorrows?
Oh, Kathleen! they say that you are pledged to wed another.
Tell me that it is not so! My one great hope is
for freedom, that I may yet have the hope of winning
you. Life without that hope would be a living death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
Oh, Kathleen, my love, my darling! pity me&mdash;pity yourself!
You have not learned to love the man you have
promised to marry. Send him from you. Wait a little,
my darling, and happiness will come to us!</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="smcap sig">"Ralph."</p>

<p>"Oh, my poor boy&mdash;my poor boy!" sobbed Kathleen.</p>

<p>She forgot herself, she forgot Teddy Darrell, to whom
she had promised herself, and she kissed Ralph Chainey's
letter with red, clinging lips, as if it had been his handsome
face.</p>

<p>"Why did I not listen to him that day when I was so
wild with jealousy that I would not let him explain?"
she cried, self-upbraidingly. "I was foolish and silly.
It is a wonder that he could ever forgive me. No. I can
not marry Teddy now. But&mdash;will&mdash;he release me&mdash;from&mdash;my
promise?"</p>

</div></div>


<p>While Kathleen was still weeping over Ralph Chainey's
appealing letter her uncle was announced.</p>

<p>She dried her tears and went down to welcome the old
man.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stone had taken the children out for the morning,
so Kathleen had a long interview with her new-found
relative.</p>

<p>He was so much like her dead father in his voice and
looks that he won Kathleen's heart at once, and when he
expressed his love and sympathy for her in moving terms,
the unhappy young girl gave him her confidence in the
fullest measure.</p>

<p>She told him the story of her young life from the beginning&mdash;her
step-mother's cruelty, Alpine's unkindness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
and Ivan's attempts at courtship, which she had repelled
with scorn.</p>

<p>Then her indignant voice softened as she murmured
over the story of her happy love-dream&mdash;her first romantic
meeting with Ralph Chainey, when he had saved
her life, and her later acquaintance with him, down to
the moment when she had repulsed him with scorn, and, in
a fit of pique, engaged herself to Teddy Darrell.</p>

<p>"I was wrong&mdash;all wrong!" she cried, self-upbraidingly,
and gave him Ralph's letter to read.</p>

<p>Benjamin Carew listened in dead silence to all that
Kathleen told him of the young actor, and if she had
observed him closely, she would have seen that his brows
were drawn together by a heavy frown.</p>

<p>Once or twice he seemed about to speak to her, but
checked himself abruptly and waited.</p>

<p>Kathleen, as soon as he had finished the letter, cried
out, eagerly:</p>

<p>"Do you not see that I was wrong to judge him so
hardly?"</p>

<p>Uncle Ben looked gravely into his niece's face and
answered, almost sternly:</p>

<p>"No; you were right, for appearances were against
him."</p>

<p>"But, dear Uncle Ben, all that is explained away now,
and I know that I was wrong not to trust my lover,"
cried the girl, anxiously.</p>

<p>But he answered, firmly:</p>

<p>"You must not call that actor your lover. You are
betrothed to Mr. Darrell."</p>

<p>"But Teddy will release me if I ask him."</p>

<p>"Would you wound your true lover so cruelly?" asked
the old man, almost angrily.</p>

<p>The beautiful dark eyes were raised to his, swimming
in tears.</p>

<p>"Oh, how unhappy I am!" cried poor Kathleen. "I
am the most wretched girl in the whole world! Every
one is against me!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>The old man did not answer. He regarded her with
sad, troubled eyes through his smoky glasses.</p>

<p>"You, too, Uncle Ben, have turned against me just
when I thought you would be such a comfort to me,"
sobbed his niece.</p>

<p>"You are willful and unjust, my child, if you expect
me to counsel you to throw over your lover for the sake
of a man who has a wife already," was the mild reply.</p>

<p>"But he will be divorced, uncle, and then we will be
free to love each other."</p>

<p>"And this honorable young man, Mr. Darrell, will be
thrown over remorselessly for the world to laugh at as a
jilted man!"</p>

<p>"Uncle Ben, I can explain it all to Teddy. He is so
good and kind he will forgive me. He would not want
to marry me if he knew that I loved another man."</p>

<p>Her heart, thrilling with the intensity of her love, lent
fire to her eyes and passion to her voice. She felt that
it would be a sin to marry Teddy with her heart so full
of Ralph.</p>

<p>But the old man she had thought so kind and gentle
rose up angrily and caught her hand.</p>

<p>"You are mad&mdash;mad, girl, to think of throwing over
Teddy Darrell for this miserable actor! You shall not
do it!" he cried, violently.</p>

<p>Kathleen tore her little white hand from his clasp in
haughty amazement.</p>

<p>"You have no right to control my actions!" she exclaimed;
and he sunk back into his chair and covered his
face with his hand.</p>

<p>"True, true!" she heard him murmur, dejectedly. "I
have no authority over my brother's child. I am only a
poor, humble old farmer, and my advice is not desired,
even though I would save my brother's only child from
wrecking her life for the sake of an unwise love! So
be it. I will go now, a sadder, wiser old man."</p>

<p>The pitiful words touched the girl's heart, melting her
resentment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>She knelt by him and drew the hand away from his
moist eyes, murmuring, remorsefully:</p>

<p>"Dear Uncle, forgive me. I was hasty, and am sorry
that I wounded you. What would you have me do?"</p>

<p>"To marry Mr. Darrell," he replied, firmly.</p>

<p>"How can I?" she moaned, wearily.</p>

<p>"At least say nothing to any one of your change of
mind just yet, Kathleen. Think a moment. Ralph
Chainey may not get his divorce. Then, were it not better,
child, for you not to compromise yourself by declaring
your love for him?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," she replied, dejectedly.</p>

<p>"Then you promise me not to have anything to say to
Ralph Chainey until the divorce is secured?" he went on,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"I promise," answered the girl, with a long, heart-breaking
sigh. "Oh!" she thought, "how cold and cruel
old people are! Surely they forget they were ever young,
or that they ever loved!"</p>

<p>But she could not bear to grieve the poor old man, and
so she gave him her promise.</p>

<p>"It is not for long, anyhow," she consoled herself with
thinking, for she thought it could not be long before Ralph
secured the divorce.</p>

<p>"Then nothing on earth shall keep us apart," she
thought, blissfully. "Poor Teddy! he will soon get over
his disappointment and love some other girl."</p>

<p>Mrs. Stone came in at this juncture, and Kathleen began
to feel quite conscience-stricken over the treachery
she was meditating to the kind lady's cousin.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, after she had cordially welcomed
Uncle Ben Carew, Mrs. Stone plunged into the subject of
which they had been speaking&mdash;Ralph Chainey.</p>

<p>"I've just met the young actor," she said; "and congratulate
me, my dear, for he likes my plot, and I am to
write him a play. Won't that be nice? For he will make
it famous. Teddy has been begging me to create a part in
it for him, and to ask Mr. Chainey to take him into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
company. Isn't it ridiculous in that spoiled boy? Why,
he will be a married man then, with no time for acting."</p>

<p>Kathleen turned the subject as quickly as she could,
and then Mrs. Stone devoted herself to Uncle Ben, persuading
him to become her guest for a week.</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted to have you, and Teddy will be
glad to have the pleasure of showing you the great sights
of Boston," she declared.</p>

<p>So it was arranged, and Mr. Darrell manfully fell into
the line of duty, escorting Uncle Ben to all the places of
interest in the city, feeling fully rewarded for all his
trouble by the murmured thanks of his beautiful betrothed.</p>

<p>So three days passed by peacefully, and although Kathleen
wept bitter tears, when alone, over the dear letter
her uncle had forbidden her to answer, she managed to
preserve a calm aspect before her friends, and they did
not guess how her heart was aching with its secret pain.
It grieved Teddy that she seemed to shrink from him a little,
but he kept on hoping he would win her love in the
end.</p>

<p>Toward the middle of the week a great surprise came
to Kathleen.</p>

<p>The long-hoped-for letter came at last.</p>

<p>The Southern relatives, so long deaf to her loving appeals,
wrote at last to say that they wanted Kathleen to
come and live with them. They were rich now, and
could make her life as gay and luxurious as it was before
her father's death.</p>

<p>"I should like to go and visit them. My heart always
yearned for my mother's people," Kathleen said, wistfully.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben was thoughtfully perusing the letter. He
answered:</p>

<p>"I will take you to them, my dear. I should not like
for you to travel alone any more."</p>

<p>"Oh, how good you are, dearest uncle!" cried the
girl, gladly. "But do you see they want me to come right
away? They want me to be there at the celebration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
my grandmother's birthday, which, she says, will be quite
an event in the Franklyn family, so that all the clan will
be gathered at the old homestead, and I can see all of
them."</p>

<p>"We can start for Richmond to-morrow," her uncle
answered, smilingly.</p>

<p>"But my diamonds, Uncle Ben. I must wait here for
them, you know," said Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Pooh! We can leave that affair in the hands of a
lawyer," he replied, carelessly.</p>

<p>He was determined that nothing should hinder this opportune
trip.</p>

<p>He was anxious to get Kathleen away from Boston,
where Ralph Chainey was playing every night to crowded
houses. It would seem as if Uncle Ben had as vigorous
a dislike for actors as his dead brother had cherished.</p>

<p>So he carefully smoothed away all her objections, declaring
that he had money enough to take them both to
Richmond, and that she could repay him, if she insisted
on it, when she got back her diamonds.</p>

<p>"I wonder if papa thought, when he gave them to me,
that some day they would be my sole little fortune!"
sighed the young girl.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben did not answer. He was looking out of
the window at the country scenery, for they were on
their journey now. Kathleen was sitting opposite to him
in the parlor car, with a big bouquet of roses in her lap,
the gift of the adoring Teddy, from whom she had just
parted at the station.</p>

<p>"A noble young fellow," Uncle Ben had said, and his
niece answered, with a little sigh:</p>

<p>"He has been very good to me; but, Uncle Ben, he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
called the greatest flirt in Boston, and I shouldn't wonder
if he threw me over at any time for a newer fancy."</p>

<p>"You are just wishing he would!" the old man exclaimed,
curtly, and she replied only by a roguish laugh.</p>

<p>The train rushed on and on through the wintry landscape,
and both of them grew very thoughtful. At last
Kathleen touched her uncle's arm with a timid hand.</p>

<p>"Uncle Ben, this going home to my mother's people
makes me think so much about <i>her</i> to-day. Tell me, did
you ever see mamma?"</p>

<p>The man's strong arm trembled under the pressure
of her little white hand, and he answered in a voice that
was hoarse with emotion:</p>

<p>"Yes, I knew little Zaidee&mdash;poor little darling!"</p>

<p>"Was she as beautiful as the portrait a great artist
made of her? There is one that hangs in my room at my
old home. It is beautiful as an angel, and papa used to
come there often to look at it. I don't think he cared for
my step-mother to know how often he came."</p>

<p>"Zaidee was more beautiful than the portrait," answered
the old man, in a low voice.</p>

<p>He pressed her little hand tenderly as it rested on his
arm, and said:</p>

<p>"Tell me all that you know about your mother, my
child."</p>

<p>"They have told me that she died by her own hand.
Was it not terrible?" whispered the young girl, with
paling lips.</p>

<p>"Terrible!" he echoed, with emotion; and then she
asked:</p>

<p>"Uncle Ben, who was to blame for that awful
tragedy?"</p>

<p>"No one," he answered, sadly. "Zaidee was passionate,
willful, jealous. She became madly jealous of a governess&mdash;a
young widow who was employed in the house
to teach her painting and music. Before poor Vincent
at all comprehended the situation, his young wife, in a
fit of anger, destroyed herself by thrusting a little jeweled
dagger into her breast."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you are sure no one was to blame?" she persisted
and after a moment's hesitation he replied:</p>

<p>"Perhaps Vince was to blame; but he did not realize it
then, poor fellow! You see, Kathleen, he worshipped his
lovely little bride, and it grieved him that she was lacking
in certain accomplishments familiar to most young girls
in his cultured set. To remedy this, he employed teachers
and Zaidee learned rapidly until&mdash;&mdash;" he passed the
back of his hand across his eyes and groaned.</p>

<p>"Until&mdash;&mdash;" repeated Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Quite unexpected by him&mdash;for she was probably too
proud to betray herself to him&mdash;Zaidee became quite
jealous of that pretty young widow, Mrs. Belmont, and in
a fit of madness took her own life, and nearly broke her
husband's heart."</p>

<p>"He married the young widow in a little more than
a year," the girl replied, unable to resist this bitter fling
at her dead father's memory.</p>

<p>He winced, the poor old man, as she spoke thus of her
father, and answered, almost excusingly:</p>

<p>"He was so wretched, and Mrs. Belmont comforted
him. She, too, had loved Zaidee, and shared his grief
with him. That was how she made herself so necessary
to the unhappy man."</p>

<p>"The fiend!" broke hissingly from Kathleen's white
lips.</p>

<p>He turned to her in amazement.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he asked, hoarsely.</p>

<p>It was well that they were alone in the car, for Kathleen's
excitement was terrible. Her eyes blazed, her
cheeks paled, her heart beat violently against her side.</p>

<p>"Uncle Ben, I am speaking of that woman who so unworthily
took my dead mother's place!" she exclaimed.
"Yes, she is a fiend! <i>She</i> to pretend that she loved the
memory of the woman she goaded to madness&mdash;perhaps
murdered; for no one saw my poor young mother drive
the fatal steel into her heart. Oh, God! what deceit&mdash;what
treachery!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>He grasped her wrist with steely fingers, his eyes
flashed with a fire akin to hers, and he whispered;</p>

<p>"Hush! You must not dare accuse <i>her</i> so! You drive
me mad! Oh, it can not be!"</p>

<p>"You take that false woman's part, then, Uncle Ben,
against me and my poor young mother? Listen, then;
let me tell you all I know&mdash;a secret I kept from my dead
father, because I believed in him, trusted him, in spite of
the servants' gossip that accused him of complicity in his
young wife's death."</p>

<p>"They dared, the hounds! accuse m-my brother thus?"
he breathed, fiercely, the perspiration starting out on his
brow, his strong frame trembling.</p>

<p>"Yes, they accused him," answered the girl. "Do not
take it so hard, Uncle Ben. He was innocent, I know;
but that fiendish woman played her part to perfection.
She made my mother believe that Vincent Carew wished
her out of the way, so that he might wed <i>her</i>, the traitress!
She made the servants believe the same. She
even plotted&mdash;&mdash;" But suddenly the girl paused with
clasped hands. "Oh! uncle, dear, it will wound you if
I mention this; it will blacken my father's memory in
your eyes&mdash;and I always loved him&mdash;I love him still, in
spite of what he has done to me, and I ought to spare
him."</p>

<p>"Go on, Kathleen. I command you to tell me everything.
I have a sacred right to know," commanded the
agitated man by her side.</p>

<p>"Listen, then, dear uncle: Just a few months before
my father went away on that foreign tour, from which
he never returned alive, I received a message from an
old woman calling me to her death-bed in the suburbs of
the city. I went, taking my maid with me. In a secret
interview that followed the dying woman told me she had
been housekeeper at the Carew mansion in my mother's
time. She could not die easy without revealing to me a
secret she had carried untold for sixteen years."</p>

<p>"That secret?" questioned Benjamin Carew, wildly.</p>

<p>"Was this," replied the girl, solemnly: "On the day of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
the tragedy, Mrs. Belmont sought the housekeeper, pretending
to be overcome with grief, surprise, and indignation.
She confided to the woman that Vincent Carew had
been making secret love to her ever since she first entered
the house, and that day had openly declared his passion,
begging her to fly with him to Europe, saying that his
ignorant child-wife would then secure a divorce, and he
could then marry his heart's best love. With tears and
shame, Mrs. Belmont owned that she could not help loving
her handsome employer, but that she had repulsed
him with scorn, and resigned her situation to take leave
immediately. Mrs. Belmont was too much overcome to
explain to her pupil, and wished the housekeeper to tell
Mrs. Carew the whole cause of her leaving."</p>

<p>"My God!" groaned the old man at Kathleen's side;
but the girl hurried on, with blazing eyes.</p>

<p>"The housekeeper, after the fashion of most servants,
was too ready to believe a tale of scandal, and to excite
a sensation. She did not think of doubting Mrs. Belmont
then, although grave doubts assailed her after the
tragedy. Well, with her heart on fire with sympathy for
her wronged mistress, she did not think for a moment of
sparing her the whole cruel truth. She blurted it all out
in burning words, and advised the outraged wife to forsake
her monster of a husband and return to her own relatives.
Within the hour mamma was found dead."</p>

<p class="center">GRANDMOTHER FRANKLYN.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I dreamed that the moon looked sadly down,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the stars with a troubled ray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I went to my darling's home&mdash;the town<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lies many a league away.<br /></span>
<span class="i26"><span class="smcap">H. Heine</span>.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Kathleen's awed voice died away in a hushed sob,
and in the grand parlor car there was a dead silence,
broken only by the clatter of the car-wheels as they
rushed over the glistening steel rails.</p>

<p>Old Benjamin Carew crouched silently in his seat,
with clinched hands and half-averted face, but Kathleen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
could see that he was pale as death, and beads of
dew stood on his forehead and around his pain-drawn
lips.</p>

<p>"How dearly he must have loved his sister-in-law&mdash;my
unhappy young mother!" she thought, tenderly;
and just then his hand moved and sought hers, clasping
it fondly, but with a grasp as cold as ice.</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Ben, I ought not to have told you this
distressing story!" she exclaimed, remorsefully. "I
am so glad to think that I never told papa the story I
had from the dying housekeeper. It would have been
so cruel for him to know that the woman he had loved
and trusted had plotted away the life of my mother."</p>

<p>"Hush, child! you drive me mad! This is too cruel!"
groaned the old man.</p>

<p>He leaned his gray head forward on the seat, and sobs,
all the fiercer for being suppressed, shook his slight
frame. Kathleen wept, too, and altogether it was a sorrowful
journey they had to the home from which Vincent
Carew had carried Zaidee, his fair young bride, to
meet so dark a fate. They talked but little, for a heavy
cloud of trouble hung over their spirits and shadowed the
future, and the young girl at length became conscious
of a strange dread of arriving at the end of the journey
so long ardently desired. She ascribed it to sudden timidity
at meeting strangers. She did not dream it was a
warning presentiment.</p>

<p>She was glad that the cars went straight through Lincoln
Station without changing. She could not bear to be
reminded of that terrible night when the talon-like fingers
of her unknown assailant had closed stranglingly about
her white throat, and of all the sorrows that had followed
after. The girl, so young and tender, shuddered
as with an ague chill, wondering how she had lived
through it all.</p>

<p>"And poor Daisy Lynn! poor Daisy Lynn! what ever
became of that unhappy girl?" she wondered, pitifully,
and her thoughts wandered to the girl's sad love story.
"How sorrowful it is to go mad for love!" she sighed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
"And yet, how sad it is to lose one's love and remain
sane and conscious in the midst of all the cruel pain.
Oh, God! am I fated to lose Ralph, my own true lover?
How shall I bear to give my hand to another man while
I love Ralph so dearly?" And when the train ran into
the station at Richmond she was weeping bitter, burning
tears for her love, Ralph, from whom she was so
cruelly parted. "Oh, the pity of it that I did not believe
in him that day that I sent him away from me in scorn,
when he was already so sorrowful! Oh, Ralph, my
darling! I did not think then that I should ever be suing
for your forgiveness for my cruel words; but now&mdash;now
I could fall at your feet for pity and pardon!" sobbed
the unhappy young girl; and there came to her a memory
of some verses she had read in the poems of Mittie Point Davis&mdash;sweet,
sad verses from a loving heart:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I did not think that I should say it first,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">About some trifle you had magnified&mdash;<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>"Richmond!" shouted the conductor, and Kathleen
roused with a start from her sad musings, and drew her
heavy wraps about her, for the opening of the car door
had let in a blast of inclement air. It was late in the
afternoon&mdash;almost twilight&mdash;and a long carriage ride was
before them; for the Franklyns had written that they
lived on the suburbs of Richmond, but would send a carriage
to meet Kathleen.</p>

<p>Sure enough, a close carriage was in waiting, the driver
an old darky who seemed surprised and even displeased
that he had two passengers instead of one.</p>

<p>"Mistis was only 'specting a lady," he observed.</p>

<p>"This is my uncle, who came along to take care of
me," Kathleen answered, with assumed cheerfulness, for
her heart was beating with a strange suspense and dread.
The old negro put her trunk up, and they entered the
carriage, and set out on a long ride that did not end until
night had wrapped its sable pall of gloom around the
earth.</p>

<p>"Oh, uncle, how glad I am that you came with me!
I should have felt so frightened all alone!" whispered
the girl, nestling close to her relative's side.</p>

<p>He answered only by a silent pressure of her little hand.
He had been strangely moody and silent ever since she
had told him the story of her mother's tragic death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>The dark, gloomy exterior of the old brick house standing
alone in thick, shrubberied grounds was not inviting,
but presently the front door opened and a gleam of light
stole forth. In its ray there appeared a witch-like old
woman huddled in a gray blanket shawl, who stood shivering
in the hall while they alighted.</p>

<p>"Howdy, granddaughter? Glad to see you!" She
gave Kathleen a cold peck on the cheek and peered
curiously at her companion. "Who's this? I warn't
expecting anybody but you, my dear. Oh, your uncle!
Howdy-do, sir? Walk right in, both of you, to the parlor.
Folks all out at a party but me. You'll see them
in the morning."</p>

<p>She ushered them into a prim, old-fashioned sitting-room
that did not show much pretension to the wealth
the Franklyns had written they were possessed of; but
Kathleen was so glad of the great glowing fire that she
ran to it and held her numb fingers to the blaze, with
scarcely a glance at her surroundings. Uncle Ben followed
her with a strange sinking at the heart.</p>

<p>His impressions of Mrs. Franklyn&mdash;Kathleen's grandmother&mdash;were
not favorable, it seemed.</p>

<p>She was unprepossessing in her looks and manners,
and she certainly regarded him in the light of an interloper.
She had not extended to him the warm welcome
that Northern people are led to believe is characteristic
of Southern hospitality.</p>

<p>Mrs. Franklyn pulled out a little table on which was
arranged a tempting little supper.</p>

<p>"I kept oysters and coffee warm for you," she said
beamingly. "Now lay off your things, both of you, and
eat before they get cold, won't you?"</p>

<p>"I am so tired&mdash;my head aches&mdash;I don't think I can swallow
a mouthful!" pleaded Kathleen, on the point of
hysterical tears.</p>

<p>Oh; why had she come? She was alarmed, somehow,
and she wondered why her heart had failed to go out
warmly to this new-found relative, as she had expected.
Instead, she experienced fear and repulsion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>But the old woman was not to be denied. She almost
forced her reluctant guests to swallow some of the food,
and then she bundled them off to their rooms with an
alacrity that savored of anxiety to be rid of their company.</p>

<p>"You must be dead tired and wanting to rest, and I'm
free to confess that it's long past my usual bed-time,"
she declared.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Uncle Ben. I hope you will rest well,"
Kathleen said, kissing the old man with quivering lips.
Then they parted, each to their separate rooms.</p>

<p>But there was no rest for Uncle Ben; his pillow was
one of thorns, and he rose and paced the floor at midnight,
restless and unhappy.</p>

<p>"My heart is on fire! Oh, God, I can not bear this
pain! Let me go out into the cold, dark streets and walk
it off!" he muttered, restlessly, and hurried into his
clothes. "I suppose I can easily slip out of this old,
ramshackle house without arousing any one," he thought
as he proceeded to open the door.</p>

<p>But he recoiled with a start, for the door was locked
on the outside! He was a prisoner in this strange house!</p>

<p class="center">IVAN RECEIVES A CHECK IN HIS CAREER.</p>

<p>When Kathleen and her uncle had left the house on
Commonwealth Avenue, Mrs. Carew turned to Ivan with
angry eyes.</p>

<p>"Is it true? Have you got that girl's diamonds?" she
inquired.</p>

<p>"Of course he has. You can read it in his guilty
face!" chimed in Alpine, contemptuously.</p>

<p>Ivan glared back at them with defiant eyes.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do about it?" he asked, insolently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>"You must return them. There will be a terrible scandal
if you do not," replied his mother.</p>

<p>"I have sold them and spent the money," he returned
with inimitable coolness.</p>

<p>"Good heavens! what will you do?" she cried; and to
her indignation he laughed out aloud as he said:</p>

<p>"You and Alpine will have to make up the four thousand
between you, and pay Kathleen!"</p>

<p>"I will not!" came in a burst of rage from Alpine's
lips, and her mother echoed it.</p>

<p>"I will not!"</p>

<p>The son leaned back indolently in his chair, not a whit
moved by their anger. They always <i>had</i> come round to
his demands. They would have to do it now.</p>

<p>"Would you bring disgrace on yourselves by having
me sent to prison to save a paltry four thousand dollars?"
he demanded, with the air of one who is master of the
situation.</p>

<p>They glared at him aghast. The two women loved
money passionately. It made them almost frantic the
way that Ivan squandered it.</p>

<p>"You two are rolling in wealth," he continued, "and
yet you begrudge a poor devil of a son and brother a few
thousand to get him out of a penitentiary scrape."</p>

<p>The listeners shuddered. Next to money, they loved
good repute, and it was the dread of their lives that the
dissolute Ivan would bring disgrace upon them. And
here it was staring them in the face. The penitentiary,
ugh!</p>

<p>"We have spent at least fifteen thousand dollars on
you since we came into this fortune!" groaned Alpine.</p>

<p>"And what you ever did with so much money, in so
short a time, I can not imagine," added Mrs. Carew.</p>

<p>"Fast living and cards," laconically replied the villain.</p>

<p>They looked at each other, the two badgered women,
and one thought was in the mind of each. Ivan was
shameless, defiant. He would never alter his evil courses
and if he went on like this, and they had to supply him
with money, he would bankrupt them in the end. Disgrace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
would come to them sooner or later through this
black sheep.</p>

<p>Alpine turned to him and asked curiously:</p>

<p>"How did you find out that Kathleen had left her
diamonds at the jewelers?"</p>

<p>He started and whitened at the suddenness of the question,
but answered, doggedly:</p>

<p>"That is my own secret, and I do not choose to disclose
it."</p>

<p>"Neither do I choose to help you out of the scrape
you have brought on yourself. Not a dollar will I give
you!" retorted Alpine, stung to defiance and rebellion
by his matchless assurance.</p>

<p>He did not believe her, and smiled as he answered:</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you will, for your own sake, my dear sister.
Perhaps you think I don't see through your little game;
but I do. You're trying to marry Ralph Chainey, the
great actor, although he does not care a pin for you.
However, you are crafty enough to hook him, I'll be
bound&mdash;only, he certainly would not look at you again
if Kathleen sent your only brother to prison for stealing
her diamonds."</p>

<p>Her blue eyes blazed on him with the steely glare of a
bitter hate; but she said, almost as if begging him to do
better:</p>

<p>"But, Ivan, if we helped you out of this, you would
be into some new scrape directly."</p>

<p>"Very likely," he replied, taking insolent pleasure in
torturing her, not dreaming she would really turn at bay.</p>

<p>But Alpine was reckless, desperate&mdash;ready to give up
the fierce contest with an untoward fate. A revengeful
longing to punish Ivan for his misdeeds, even at the bitterest
cost to herself, assailed her and drove everything
else out of her mind. Her eyes flashed, her face grew
ashen, and, turning to her mother, she said, in a low, tense
voice:</p>

<p>"You see how it is, mamma. If we help him out of
this, it will be something else directly. How can we bear
the strain for years? Do what we will, he will beggar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
and disgrace us sooner or later. Why not let the end
come now? Let&mdash;Kathleen send him to prison for his
crime, and we&mdash;we&mdash;can live it down as best we may."</p>

<p>Every word fell like a drop of ice on the ingrate's heart.
Did she mean it? Would they desert him at last, these
two?</p>

<p>He was frightened, and yet incredulous. He had heard
and read and believed that there was no limit to the love
and forgiveness of a mother's and sister's heart.</p>

<p>But he had gone too far in his insolent assurance, and,
to his terror and amazement, his hour of reckoning had
come at last.</p>

<p>He did not take into account the fact that he did not
have a good woman for a mother. His excesses had
turned her heart against him, and to his horror she sided
with Alpine, angrily discarding him.</p>

<p>"I wash my hands of you," she said, bitterly. "Kathleen
may send you to prison if she will. Alpine and I
can go abroad. The affair will soon blow over, and people
will forget it by the time we come home from Europe."</p>

<p>He dropped his <i>insouciance</i>, and descended to pleading,
but it was of no avail. He saw a black fate lowering
over him from which there seemed no escape.</p>

<p>In the darkest moment a clever idea came to him.</p>

<p>"If I could only escape to Europe, the whole affair
would be over, for I would never come back; but, alas!
I have not the means to pay my passage across the ocean,"
he said, despondently.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carew caught eagerly at the offered bait.</p>

<p>"If you <i>will</i> go and never return, I will furnish you the
means," she said.</p>

<p>"I swear it," he replied, and left the house presently, the
money in his pocket, an evil, sneering smile on his thin
lips.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jones had said to Miss Belmont:</p>

<p>"Mr. Chainey has been waiting in the drawing-room
some time to see you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>"You should have told me sooner," she exclaimed,
flashing at the prospect of seeing Ralph.</p>

<p>"I did not like to interrupt you, miss," he replied, respectfully,
but Alpine did not wait to hear his apology;
she hurriedly sought the man she loved.</p>

</div></div>


<p>Ralph had been waiting many minutes for Miss Belmont,
but he had forgotten the lapse of time in his agitation
over the meeting with Kathleen, and he rose with almost
a start to meet the beautiful blonde, who hurried to
him with both hands extended in rapturous greeting.</p>

<p>"So glad," she murmured, with the loveliest upward
glance, that was quite lost on Ralph, for he did not notice
it, but exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I had quite a surprise coming in just now. I met Miss
Carew. So she has repented and come home?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and no&mdash;it was only a formal call. Kathleen is
so proud she will not come back to us, even for the short
time before her marriage," answered Alpine.</p>

<p>She sighed, and he echoed it; but it was of Kathleen
he was thinking&mdash;bonny Kathleen. Alpine guessed it,
and bit her lips, then plunged into an animated account of
Uncle Ben Carew, making him appear in the most ridiculous
light.</p>

<p>"He was an impostor, of course. Mamma is quite sure
that my step-father never had a brother," she said.</p>

<p>"But Kathleen believed in him?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. Was it not strange she should let herself be
deceived by such a designing schemer? She carried him
off as her guest at Mrs. Stone's."</p>

<p>He was silent, wondering if Kathleen had made a mistake,
and suddenly Alpine said, sweetly:</p>

<p>"Now please put Kathleen out of your mind and think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
of no one but me while you are here. Am I not your
friend, and haven't I some claim on you?"</p>

<p>Something in her tone startled him. He glanced hurriedly
into her face and read as in a book all her love
and longing. Her eyes met his and held them as if fascinated.
While he gazed she started forward and caught
his hand in hers, murmuring, hysterically:</p>

<p>"I have betrayed myself. You know my heart now.
Oh, Ralph! forgive me that I could not hide my love for
you! Forgive me, and try to love me a little in return."</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" cried the young man, aghast, withdrawing
his hand hurriedly from her grasp and looking
at her in consternation.</p>

<p>But Alpine, already excited and unnerved by the scene
with her brother, could not draw back now, having betrayed
her secret. She cried out, pleadingly:</p>

<p>"Do not turn from me so angrily. Is it a crime to love
you&mdash;to wish for your love?"</p>

<p>She recalled him to the fact that he was acting rudely,
that he ought not to let this unhappy girl see the disgust
with which she had inspired him by her avowal of love.</p>

<p>It was most embarrassing. He longed to get away,
for he did not know what to say. He was utterly
abashed, and obeying a sudden impulse, sprung to his feet
and turned to the door.</p>

<p>"Miss Belmont, I&mdash;I hope you will&mdash;excuse me, but I
have&mdash;have just remembered something&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;important&mdash;a
rehearsal. Will you pardon my haste? Good-bye,"
he stammered, like a bashful school-boy, and instantly
fled the scene, leaving Alpine to fling herself upon
a sofa in a burst of hysterical tears.</p>

<p>"Oh, why did I betray my bitter secret! I was mad&mdash;mad!
and now I have driven him from my side forever
by my imprudence!" she sobbed in the wildest <i>abandon</i>.</p>

<p>As she lay there sobbing, her hatred and jealousy of
her beautiful step-sister grew stronger than ever. It was
for love of Kathleen that Ralph Chainey had turned from
her when she had humbled herself to him and sued for
his love.</p>

<p>Some touching verses rang in sad melody through her brain.</p>

<p>She dashed the tears from her eyes and sat up, the picture
of shame and despair.</p>

<p>"I could have been a better woman if he had been kind
to me&mdash;if he would but have promised to try to love me!"
she muttered, angrily. "But how fast he hurried away,
as if he despised me. How I wish I could hate him in return&mdash;hate
him as I hate his dark-eyed love! It is for <i>her</i>
he scorns me. Oh, God! for vengeance on them both!"</p>

<p class="center">A TERRIBLE CRIME.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Deep and dark the flowing river,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Close to the feet like a serpent glides;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Many a secret lost forever<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The deep and beautiful water hides!"<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Our Kathleen did not share the wakefulness of her relative.</p>

<p>On the contrary, a strange drowsiness stole over her as
soon as she entered the shabby little bedroom to which
Mrs. Franklyn conducted her with such alacrity.</p>

<p>"Get a good rest, that's a dear! and in the morning
you shall see them all," she said, wheedlingly; and giving
Kathleen a cold little kiss on the cheek, she retreated,
leaving her guest alone.</p>

<p>Kathleen flung off her clothes, shivering in the fireless
room, slipped into her gown, and crept between the sheets,
murmuring over her prayers in the bed because it was
too cold outside. Then, with the tears still wet on her
lashes, she fell into a heavy slumber.</p>

<p>Presently the door opened again noiselessly, and the
old woman's head was thrust inside the room. She
gave a low grunt of satisfaction as she heard the deep
breathing of Kathleen, and closed the door.</p>

<p>Silence again in the old house; but if any one had been
listening they would have heard outside, in the chilly
night, the stamp of the horses that had brought the uncle
and niece to this place. The cab was waiting yet. Why,
and for whom?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>The night was intensely dark, it was freezing cold, and
the driver did not have to wait long.</p>

<p>The door opened softly in a little while, and a man
and a woman stole out bearing between them a figure
wrapped up in a long cloak. They pushed their dead or
living burden, whichever it was, into the cab, entered
themselves, and were driven a long distance, until the
low murmur of a river rushing between its banks was distinctly
heard. At a quiet, unfrequented spot they came to
a stop; the two people got out again, and carried their
burden to the river-bank; then there was a thud, a splash,
and then they turned away, their arms empty of the load
they had brought. In the silence and darkness of the
wintry night a terrible crime had been committed.</p>

<p>Alas! poor Kathleen, poor orphan-girl, the sport of a
most malignant fate! Heaven help thee now, drifting
upon the dark, mysterious waves of the gloomy river,
beneath the pall of the ink-black heavens, unlighted by
either moon or star!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile, the old man, locked into his room like a
rat in a trap, was bending all his feeble efforts toward
releasing himself.</p>

<p>He feared to make an outcry, for he comprehended
instinctively that treachery lurked in the air of the old
house, with its forbidding mistress&mdash;treachery and danger
to himself and helpless Kathleen.</p>

<p>He sunk back helplessly upon the bed, at first shaken
and unnerved by his terrible suspicions. Sweeping his
hand across his brow, he muttered:</p>

<p>"My door was locked on the outside by design to bar
me out from my child&mdash;my bonny Kathleen. What have
they done to her? or what are they going to do?"</p>

<p>He crept cautiously to the window and pushed up the
sash. Horrors! it was barred across with iron as closely
as a prison; and again he fell to raving of treachery and
danger.</p>

<p>"That woman was not Mrs. Franklyn. I did not believe
at first that it could be poor Zaidee's mother. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
could not have changed so much in seventeen years, I
knew; yet I could not speak out then, lest I betray myself.
I thought I would wait for the developments of
to-morrow. Alas! it was a fatal resolve. We were decoyed
here by the trick of some deadly enemy, and every
moment that I remain locked up here Kathleen is in the
most deadly peril. God in Heaven help me to escape,
that I may succor my poor child!"</p>

<p>Desperate with fears for Kathleen, he threw himself
against the door and shook it with all his might. The
sounds rang through the house, but no one came to release
him. He shrieked aloud, but no voice replied to
his frantic calls.</p>

<p>In his misery an awful suspicion had come to him.</p>

<p>He remembered Kathleen's threat to Ivan Belmont,
that she would send him to prison unless she received the
value of her stolen diamonds.</p>

<p>What if that villain had laid a deadly trap to decoy
Kathleen to this place and murder her to save himself the
payment of that pitiful sum! This affair looked like it.
Perhaps she was already murdered&mdash;his beautiful Kathleen,
that he loved so dearly, and whom he had brought
here in his mistaken eagerness to get her away from
Boston.</p>

<p>Searching frantically about, he perceived with joy an
old rusty poker beneath the iron fender of the fire-place.
He seized it, and with the strength of a madman wrenched
the lock from the door. It flew open. He was free.</p>

<p>Then ensued the most piteous search the world ever
knew&mdash;the old man's frantic search for missing Kathleen.</p>

<p>It was all in vain. The old house was empty, the girl
was gone, the old woman was gone, and the night-wind,
as it sighed around the gables of the lonely old house, did
not whisper to him of the awful secret the river hid.</p>

<p>Ralph Chainey waited in cruel suspense for an answer
to the appealing letter he had sent to Kathleen.</p>

<p>But long days passed and no letter came from his
heart's love. Then he saw the announcement in a morning
paper that she had gone away with her uncle to visit
her Southern relatives.</p>

<p>"Cruel girl! she has gone without a word or sign. She
hates me indeed, and will never forgive my boyhood's
folly," he groaned, despairingly.</p>

<p>The first shock of pain and disappointment was so
great that he could scarcely bear it. He thought vaguely
of suicide, wondered which would be the easier way out
of life&mdash;the dagger, the bullet, poison, or the river.
Shakespeare's words came to him:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, that the Everlasting had not fixed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! Oh, God! Oh, God!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seem to me all the uses of this world."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He got up suddenly and shook himself with fierce self-scorn.</p>

<p>"God forgive me for these wild thoughts!" he cried.
"No, I can not be such a coward! He is a coward who
takes his own life because he can not bear its ills. I must
remember that I have a dear little mother to live for, even
though the hope of love and happiness be gone forever."</p>

<p>But life was cruel. He longed to get away somewhere&mdash;far
away from the place where everything breathed of
<i>her</i>, his cruel, beautiful love, and he decided that as soon
as he secured his divorce he would go abroad and seek
forgetfulness in constant travel.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a sorrowful little note came to him from
Alpine, praying him to forget her folly, or at least to
keep it secret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I should die of shame if I believed any one knew but
you," she wrote. "But you are so good and great, you
can forgive me. Perhaps things like that have happened
to you before. I should not wonder. Then do not
exclude me from your friendship, I pray you. Forget that
one mad moment, and think kindly of me as you did
before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="sig2">"Your true friend,</p>
<p class="smcap sig">"Alpine."</p>

<p>With the letter was a little perfumed sheet on which
were written some sweet, sad verses that touched his
heart:</p>

<p class="center">"THE FAREWELL.</p>

<span class="i0">"Ah, yes! I can bid you farewell and forever,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Ralph read the verses penned in Alpine's hand with
deep emotion, but it was not of <i>her</i>, it was of another
he thought. The sweet, sorrowful strain seemed to express
his feelings toward his lost Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Lost to me forever!" he sighed, bitterly. "Teddy
Darrell, the boyish flirt, who roves from one beauty to another,
like a butterfly from flower to flower, will win and
wear the peerless rose, beautiful Kathleen. He is not
worthy of her, for he has frittered his heart away in a
score of passions, while mine has aye been true to her
since first we met."</p>

<p>He could not help hating the fortunate Teddy because
he had won Kathleen; and Teddy, who was a versatile
youth, envied him, in his turn, his genius and his fame,
and was fired with the desire of becoming a great actor.
He was always dabbling at some new fad; but Mrs. Stone,
who understood him thoroughly, declared that Teddy
would never accomplish anything great unless he should
lose his fortune and have to work for his living.</p>

<p>It was lonesome for Teddy the first few days after
Kathleen went away, and he was fain to console himself
with some of his old sweethearts. While pursuing this
diversion with the usual alacrity of a young man whose
sweetheart is away, he met a new girl who proved
"quite a bonanza," as he confided to Mrs. Stone.</p>

<p>"Saw her at Maude Sylvester's. By the way, Maude's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
novel, 'A Blinding Passion,' is having quite a success,
don't you know? Well, as I was saying, this girl, Mittie
Poindexter, is a real daisy, and suits me down to the
ground&mdash;talks about going on the stage."</p>

<p>"Kathleen would be jealous if she could hear how you
run on!" his cousin exclaimed, warningly.</p>

<p>"Not a bit!" he replied, his frank brow clouding with
vexation. "To tell you the truth, Carrie, I don't believe
she loves me in the least; it's only gratitude that made her
promise to be mine. Only think, now, Carrie: she has
been gone three days, and not one line to me, although
I've written <i>her</i> two letters a day. Why, don't you know,
that week I went to New York I began a letter to her as
soon as the train started, and, by Jove! I mailed it at the
first station. I'm ashamed to think of all the spoony
letters I wrote that girl in one week, and&mdash;<i>only one little
note in return for all!</i>"</p>

<p>Mrs. Stone could not help laughing at his half-injured
air.</p>

<p>"Well, never mind. You have a special talent for
letter-writing, you know, and Kathleen detests writing;
she told me so. That accounts for her failure to write
oftener," she began, soothingly; but just then the door-bell
rang a resounding peal, and she started up in dismay.</p>

<p>"What a deafening ring! Maybe that's the postman
now. No, it is too early for <i>him</i>. What is it, Mary?
Oh, a telegram! Open it, please, Teddy. Those things
always startle us women folks so."</p>

<p>His handsome face paled to an ashen hue, and his lips
trembled as he read.</p>

<p>It was a telegram from Richmond, and contained these
startling words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Ask Mr. Darrell to join me here at once, if possible.
Kathleen has mysteriously disappeared under circumstances
that hint of foul play.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="smcap sig">"Benjamin Carew."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>"Kathleen gone! Oh, Heaven! my little darling!"
groaned the young man, forgetting all about his new
fancy in real grief and dismay.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stone burst into tears, and for a few minutes one
could not comfort the other.</p>

<p>But women are more quick-witted than men, and Mrs.
Stone, who knew nothing about Ivan Belmont and the
diamonds, quickly leaped to a conclusion.</p>

<p>"Those asylum people&mdash;the fools!&mdash;have captured her
again, and carried her off to their old prison!" she exclaimed,
brightening and wiping away her tears. "Cheer
up, Teddy. No harm can happen your little sweetheart,
except another detention at the lunatic asylum, and you
and her uncle can soon have her out when you find out
exactly where the place is situated."</p>

<p>Her idea was so plausible that Teddy brightened up
under its influence and prepared to take leave.</p>

<p>"I must go on the first train," he said, as he kissed
his cousin good-bye after the affectionate way he affected
with all his female relatives who had the slightest claim to
good looks.</p>

<p>The news spread rapidly, and Helen Fox, arriving the
next day from Europe, was shocked at the calamity that
had overtaken her friend. The news that Kathleen lived
had thrilled her with joy, and hastened her return from
abroad.</p>

<p>That was not all the news that shocked her, for she
soon became acquainted with Ralph Chainey's pathetic
story.</p>

<p>Helen was a frank, far-seeing girl, but she could not
understand the strange turn matters had taken during
her absence. The next day after her return she told
her brother George to bring Ralph Chainey home to
luncheon.</p>

<p>"I have been dying to see you ever since I got back,"
she said to him, frankly, her blue eyes beaming with the
kindness of her heart. "Now tell me <i>everything</i>!"</p>

<p>Luncheon was over, and they were alone in the cozy
library together. Helen looked sympathetically at the unhappy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
young man, remembering how, such a little time
ago, she had plotted in her loving fashion to bring about
a match between him and her bonny Kathleen. He comprehended
her sympathy, and opened his full heart to her
with all its pain and anguish.</p>

<p class="center">THE FRANKLYNS AT LAST!</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I knew by the smoke that so gracefully curled<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Above the green elms that a cottage was near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I said, "If there's peace to be found in the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A heart that was humble might hope for it here."<br /></span>
<span class="i26"><span class="smcap">Thomas Moore</span>.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>River Cottage was one of the prettiest spots on the
banks of the James, and so far away from any other habitation
that it was lonely to the last degree; yet embowered
in trees and vines and flowers, and lulled by the
murmuring voice of the majestic river, its inhabitants
were so happy and content that they did not pine for the
world that at a little distance surged busily around them.
The family consisted of but two&mdash;Mrs. Franklyn, a lovely
old woman somewhat past fifty, and her grandson, a youth
of twenty-three years. Here at River Cottage they lived
quietly together on a modest competency, the woman with
her sad face and dreamy eyes absorbed altogether in
dreams of her past and in tender care for Chester, the
blue-eyed boy under whose crown of yellow curls
throbbed the restless brain of a genius that was beginning
to express itself in dainty bits of verse&mdash;the first
callow flights of ambition.</p>

<p>The boy was restless. Genius was beginning to burn.
Sometimes he walked the floor for hours while the midnight
oil burned on his study table. At times he loved
to walk on the banks of the river, setting his beautiful
thoughts to the music of its melodious rhythm. On that
dark, cold night Chester had wandered from the cottage
porch down to the river's edge, and so he caught with
startled ears the sound of that sullen splash into the
waves&mdash;caught the sound, and scarce a minute later saw,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
with keen eyes strained into the gloom, a body floating
in the river past the cottage.</p>

<p>"A suicide!" he muttered, in a voice of horror.</p>

<p>The next minute he threw off his coat and shoes and
plunged into the stream.</p>

<p>It was a brave deed, and sometimes in the anguished
months that came afterward Chester wondered if he
would have risked so much could he but have known all
that was to follow on this night&mdash;the full draught of life's
chalice filled to the brim with love and pain that he was
to quaff. But no presentiment of the future came to him
now as he struggled in the almost freezing waves until
he caught and held the form drifting rapidly from him,
and by almost superhuman efforts drew it with him to the
shore.</p>

<p>Mrs. Franklyn always dwelt with loving pride on that
night when the cottage door was pushed open and her
brave boy staggered in with his unconscious burden, both
of them dripping water upon her pretty ingrain carpet,
and Chester faltered weakly:</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I have saved&mdash;some one&mdash;from the river!" Then
he fell upon the floor, too exhausted to utter another
word.</p>

<p>Mrs. Franklyn did not look at the stranger at first.
She hastened to revive Chester by pouring some wine
between his pale lips and chattering teeth. As soon as
he could he sat up, saying, anxiously:</p>

<p>"There, grandma! I'm all right. See about the woman,
please."</p>

<p>And then they found that the woman he had rescued
was a young girl&mdash;the most beautiful golden-haired young
creature they had ever beheld. When they had used some
little effort at restoring her to consciousness, she opened
on their faces a pair of large, dark, wondering eyes, at
whose gaze Chester Franklyn's romantic heart leaped
up in a sort of ecstasy. He stooped down, almost unconsciously,
and pressed his lips to her icy little hand, carried
out of himself by some strange, delicious emotion he could
not resist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>Tears started to Mrs. Franklyn's eyes as she busied
herself about the patient, who did not answer one word
when she spoke to her, but lay watching her face with
dazed, uncomprehending eyes. The good lady sent Chester
up to his room to put on dry garments, and brought
some of her own for the strange young girl thrown upon
her care.</p>

<p>She supposed that this was an attempted suicide, and
wondered what terrible sorrow had driven this beautiful
young girl to self-destruction.</p>

<p>She ventured to ask the patient the question, but Kathleen
seemed dazed as yet, and did not comprehend anything
very clearly. She answered to every question that
was asked her a feeble: "I don't know."</p>

<p>"I must wait until she gets better," was her thought;
and she put Kathleen to bed, carefully spreading out her
long gold curls over the pillow to dry. Soon the girl
fell asleep, and then Mrs. Franklyn turned down the lamp
and slipped away to ask Chester all about it.</p>

<p>He could tell her nothing but that he had heard the
dull thud of her body striking the water, and that he
jumped into the river to save her. He believed it was a
suicide, as he had heard no sound or cry.</p>

<p>"Some poor girl, perhaps, who can not make an honest
living and has sought death in her despair," he said,
and the gentle lady agreed with him.</p>

<p>"We will keep her here until she gets well and strong,
and then we will see how we can help her out of her
trouble," she added, kindly.</p>

<p>"Yes, we will take care of her," cried Chester Franklyn,
eagerly. "It may be she has some deadly enemies
from whom she sought to escape in that terrible fashion.
We will say nothing of her being here until she herself
tells us what to do."</p>

<p>When the morrow dawned Kathleen was ill with a low
fever, and so it chanced that while her friends were
frantic with anxiety over her fate, Kathleen lay passive
in the river cottage, carefully watched by Mrs. Franklyn,
who wondered much over her mysterious guest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>"So young and beautiful; and she can not be a poor
girl, for her clothing is of the finest quality," Mrs. Franklyn
said to her grandson. "Perhaps there are people
who are anxious over her fate. Do you think we ought
to let it be known through the papers?" she added.</p>

<p>"No, not yet. Let us wait till she gets well and tells
us what to do," he replied.</p>

<p>Chester Franklyn had fallen in love at first sight with
the beautiful creature whose life he had saved. He was
afraid that some one would take her away from him if
he let her presence be known.</p>

<p>"Let me have my chance first," he said to himself, with
all the selfish ardor of a young lover.</p>

<p>It seemed strange that Kathleen lay passive so long
after the fever left her, without seeming to take any interest
in anything. They asked her her name; they asked
her where her home was, and how she came to be in the
river. To everything she answered dreamily:</p>

<p>"I do not know."</p>

<p>They did not know that before Kathleen had been
thrown into the river she had swallowed with her food
a potent drug intended to produce death. It was entirely
owing to the small quantity of food she had taken that
she survived at all, but the strange drug had partially
paralyzed her faculties. Memory was dormant, or returned
in such faint gleams that it threw no light on her
present state.</p>

<p>She knew that two beautiful, kindly faces&mdash;a woman's
old but strangely lovely, and a young man's with deep
blue eyes and curls of gold&mdash;bent daily over her pillow.
She watched them eagerly, she smiled at them faintly and
sweetly, but so numb were her reasoning faculties that
she did not wonder at their presence there. She was utterly
quiescent.</p>

<p>Mrs. Franklyn became alarmed, fearing the girl was
an idiot, but Chester was indignant at the very idea.</p>

<p>"She has had some shock; that is it," he said. "Be
patient, grandma. She will come to herself."</p>

<p>It was strange how his heart went out to the girl, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
lay so silently on the pillow all day, looking up at him
with dark, inscrutable eyes, like an infant's in their wondering
expression.</p>

<p>In a week she seemed stronger. She could sit up in
an easy-chair. She even talked a little, but it was just
about things that she saw in the room&mdash;books, pictures,
flowers. She would say, softly:</p>

<p>"How sweet! How pretty!"</p>

<p>At last she was strong enough to walk about the room.</p>

<p>"Grandma, I think she would like it better in the parlor,"
said Chester, one day. He took her hand and led
her into a pretty, cozy apartment.</p>

<p>Kathleen sat down in front of a bright coal fire, and
leaned her curly head back against the easy-chair. In
doing so, her upraised eyes encountered over the mantel
the picture of a young girl done in water colors. It was
a life-size head and bust, and represented a beautiful
young creature with rosy cheeks, pouting lips, dark-blue
eyes, and curly golden hair. The expression of the face
was piquant and spirited, and greatly resembled Kathleen's
own.</p>

<p>Kathleen gazed with startled eyes at this beautiful picture,
and gasped, faintly:</p>

<p>"Who is it?"</p>

<p>She was alone with Chester, and as he looked up she
saw a shadow of pain cloud his dark-blue eyes.</p>

<p>Drawing his chair close to hers, he half-whispered:</p>

<p>"She was my cousin. She has been dead many years."</p>

<p>"Her name?" exclaimed Kathleen, excitedly, and he
lifted a warning hand.</p>

<p>"Not so loud. Grandma might hear," he said; then,
answering the puzzled look in her eyes, he added, softly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was grandma's youngest child&mdash;her only daughter,
and she met such a tragic fate that it nearly broke
her mother's heart. Even now she can not bear to talk
of her. We never speak her name, because it makes our
hearts ache."</p>

<p>"It was Zaidee&mdash;Zaidee Franklyn," murmured the
girl.</p>

<p>"How did you know?" in astonishment.</p>

<p>"No matter. Tell me all about her," answered Kathleen,
whose memory had returned to her as by a flash of
lightning at sight of that lovely face.</p>

<p>"There is little to tell," he replied. "My poor cousin's
story is short and tragic, like her life. My grandmother
had but two children, a son and a daughter. The son,
my father, died years ago, but Zaidee, his petted young
sister, died years before&mdash;died, alas! by her own hand."</p>

<p>She shivered like one in a chill, and he said:</p>

<p>"Was it not horrible? She was so young, so lovely,
and she had everything, it seemed, to make her happy.
But this is her story: When she was barely sixteen, a
rich man from Boston married her and took her away
from her simple home to his grand, rich one. She loved
her handsome husband very dearly, and seemed to be
wildly happy. Her people did not hear from her often,
but she sent this picture and many gifts to her mother.
In a year she had a little daughter, but she did not invite
grandma to go and see the child. Vincent Carew was rich
and great, and very proud, so the Franklyns believed that
he was trying to break his young wife off entirely from
her past. The Franklyns were proud, too, in their way.
They resented it; and so the communication between the
two families almost ceased, until, suddenly, like a clap
of thunder, came the news that the young wife had committed
suicide!"</p>

<p>"Why?" she gasped.</p>

<p>"We do not know. It was a profound mystery even
to her husband. But it broke my grandfather's heart.
He died in less than a week after the news came.
Grandma came, then, to live with us at River Cottage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
My mother died in a few years after, then my father.
We two&mdash;grandma and I&mdash;are the last of the family
unless my cousin, Kathleen Carew, Zaidee's child, is yet
living. That we do not know. We wrote several times.
No answer came, and we gave up the hope of ever knowing
the daughter of the proud Vincent Carew."</p>

<p>"And she has never written to you?" asked the girl,
in wonder.</p>

<p>"Never," he replied.</p>

<p>"There must be some mistake," she faltered.</p>

<p>"No, there is no mistake; but I fancy the proud
Vincent Carew is at the bottom of it all. He would not
care for his child to know her humble relatives on her
mother's side. Why, he was governor of his state eight
years, and was in Congress also. The Franklyns were
plain simple people; my grandfather and my father were
mechanics, although nobler hearts never beat in human
breasts, and they were never rich. It is from the life-insurance
money they left us that we are enabled to live in
comparative comfort now."</p>

<p>Her eager, interested eyes made him go on rather diffidently:</p>

<p>"As for me, I have no taste that way. My desire is
for a literary life. I have written some trifles that the
critics praised."</p>

<p>"Your name?" the girl asked, curiously, gazing with
interest at his handsome face.</p>

<p>"Chester Franklyn," he replied.</p>

<p>"Would you like to meet your unknown cousin&mdash;the
daughter of the proud Vincent Carew?" she pursued.</p>

<p>His face grew grave.</p>

<p>"I do not know how to answer you," he replied. "She
would not care for us. Perhaps her father has never told
her about the Franklyns."</p>

<p>She looked at him with a strange expression, and held
out to him her little white hand.</p>

<p>"I am your cousin&mdash;I am Kathleen Carew!" she said
to him; and, while he stared in astonishment, she pointed
at the picture of the beautiful girl.</p>

<p>"She was my mother!" she said.</p>

<p class="center">A COUSIN FOR A LOVER.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah! love was never yet without<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pang, the agony, the doubt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which rends my heart with ceaseless sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While day and night roll darkling by.<br /></span>
<span class="i26"><span class="smcap">Byron</span>.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>What a day that was!</p>

<p>Kathleen seemed suddenly to grow well and strong at
the wonderful discovery that it was her own cousin who
had saved her life, and that the sweet, lovely woman
who had cared for her so kindly was her own dear grandmother.</p>

<p>They had volumes to tell each other; and how Mrs.
Franklyn was shocked when she heard that a decoy letter,
pretending to be from herself, had at last brought
Kathleen to Richmond.</p>

<p>She wept bitterly at the thought that her precious
granddaughter had so nearly lost her life through this
mysterious treachery.</p>

<p>"My dear, I never wrote you a line, nor did I ever
hear from you. I thought you were too proud to care
about us; so I let you alone, although it nearly broke my
poor heart!"</p>

<p>She gazed with untiring love at the beautiful face, trying
to trace in it every faint resemblance to her dead
daughter.</p>

<p>"You are more like your father than your mother,"
she said, with vague disappointment. "Your eyes, your
features are his; but there is an expression like Zaidee's,
and your hair is gold like hers was, only a richer, deeper
shade. You are more beautiful even than Zaidee was,"
she continued, fondly, as she stroked the bronze-gold
curls.</p>

<p>Chester had little to say. He looked and listened
eagerly, his heart thrilling at the thought that Kathleen
was his cousin, and in a measure belonged to them.</p>

<p>"For her father has disinherited her; her step-mother
cast her off. We are her nearest and dearest, and she
will stay with us and share our lot," he said within himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>Kathleen, while confiding very freely in them, had held
back with a young girl's shyness the story of her love
affair and her engagement of marriage. She did not suppose
they would care for <i>that</i>, and she was so anxious
to know what had befallen her uncle that she dwelt constantly
on that subject.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they murdered him, too," she sobbed. "Oh,
cousin! will you not telegraph at once to my friends in
Boston, and let them know where I am? Perhaps in that
way I may get news of him sooner. And they will be so
uneasy over my fate."</p>

<p>"They?" the young man repeated, with his curious
eyes upon her face.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Stone, my friend, and&mdash;Mr. Darrell&mdash;the man
I am to marry," explained Kathleen, with a blush.
Her eyes had dropped, so she did not see the ashen pallor
that suddenly overspread Chester Franklyn's face. "You
will telegraph at once, will you not, cousin?" she repeated,
and hastily scribbled down the addresses upon a
card.</p>

<p>"I will go at once," he answered, taking the slip of
paper and leaving the room. But a terrible temptation
had assailed him. "Why not wait a little before I send
the telegrams!" he thought. "I can not give her up just
yet to the proud, rich man she is going to marry. If she
stays with us a little longer, I may, perhaps, win beautiful
Kathleen from him. It ought to be so. Grandma and
I ought to have Zaidee's child for our own because we
have been cheated of her sweetness all our lives. I&mdash;will&mdash;not&mdash;send
the telegrams just yet. She will never
know."</p>

<p>He had often read the saying that "all is fair in love
and war," and it seemed to him that there could be nothing
unfair in this. But yet his heart smote him when he
went back and met the eager light in the dark eyes he
loved so well.</p>

<p>"They will be so much relieved when they know that
I am safe and well," she exclaimed. "And as soon as
they can they will come for me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are in a great hurry to leave us!" Chester cried,
reproachfully.</p>

<p>"No, indeed, for I love you both dearly," the girl replied,
not dreaming how his heart leaped at the words.
"But I am so anxious over the fate of my uncle. Only
think, cousin, I do not know if he is dead or alive. Perhaps
they drowned him, too;" and her eyes filled with
tears.</p>

<p>"Try and bear the suspense as well as you can. I will
try to amuse you," and he kept his word as far as lay
in his power. He read to her, sung to her, played games,
talked, and Kathleen would have really enjoyed his company
only for the cruel suspense of her waiting.</p>

<p>"It is strange they do not come. It almost seems as if
they did not care for me," she said, wistfully, on the third
day.</p>

<p>"They will come to-morrow. Do not think about them
now. I want to sing you this sweet little song," he said,
going over to the piano and seating himself.</p>

<p>He had found out that the best way to amuse or interest
Kathleen was to read or sing to her while she lay
quietly on the sofa, her arms over her head, her dark,
curly lashes drooping over her sad, dreamy eyes. Many
a time when he was not looking, the burning tears ran
down her cheeks as she thought of Ralph, her dear, lost
lover, who was brought so vividly to mind by Chester's
poetry and songs.</p>

<p>So she lay very still now while Chester, who really
played and sung very well, poured out in the sweet love-song
the passion that filled his heart.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When nightly my wild harp I bring<br /></span>
<span class="i3">To wake all its music for thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So sweet looks that face while I sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">To reason no longer I'm free.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I forget thou art queen of the land,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">'Tis thy beauty alone that I see!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And trembling at touch of thy hand,<br /></span>

<span class="i3">And the hope of my slumbers resign.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ah, hadst thou been less than thou art,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Or I more deserving of thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thou mightst have been queen of my heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Thou mightst have been all things to me."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Tears came to the singer's eyes and tears to the listener's,
the words were so wildly sad. Chester thought of
<i>her</i>, she of Ralph, so strange are love's entanglements.</p>

<p>"Go on," she murmured, unwilling that he should
turn and see the burning tear-drops in her eyes,
so Chester selected another song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I've something to ask you to-night, Kathleen,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A secret I fain would know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, why do you seem so strange, Kathleen,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And why do you shun me so?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come out on the porch in the starlight, sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And tell me my joy or woe&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your coldness is breaking my heart, Kathleen,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">You were never in earnest&mdash;were those your words?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was that what you meant to say?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your tones were so strangely low, Kathleen,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet I fancied I heard you say:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I never loved you." Was that your voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or the south wind's dreamy sigh?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kathleen, Kathleen, you are dreaming, love,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or perhaps it is only I!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Go and forget you? Kathleen, Kathleen,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Your light words were spoken in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The revel was wild, and the wine flowed red,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But it never drowned his pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till under the sod in the autumn days<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He pillowed his dreamless head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With "Twenty" carved on the marble slab<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For he was but a boy, <i>she</i> said.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And Kathleen goes on her lightsome way,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And smiles at his simple heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dazzles and lures as she dazzled him<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With the coquette's Circean art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While under the daisy-dimpled turf,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A-sleeping light and low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heart-broken molder the lips that sighed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Kathleen, I love you so!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He turned around on the piano-stool and looked at her.
She was sitting upright, her dark eyes wide and startled.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," he said, gently. "The name was Irene,
but I put in yours because it rhymed so well."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>"But why do you choose such sad songs?" she said.
"They make my heart ache."</p>

<p>"Because mine aches already," he answered, impulsively;
and, seating himself by her side, he continued,
passionately: "Darling Kathleen, I love you, and, unless
you will give me your love in return, I shall die of heartbreak,
like that poor lad in the song."</p>

<p>She remained perfectly silent a moment, then answered,
rebukingly:</p>

<p>"But you are my cousin."</p>

<p>"Cousins often marry," he replied, eagerly.</p>

<p>"But I can not marry you, Chester; I am engaged to
marry a young man in Boston. Besides, I don't love you,"
she replied.</p>

<p>"Do you love <i>him</i>?"</p>

<p>"Of&mdash;course," she replied; but her voice faltered as
she thought how impossible it was for her to love Teddy,
because of that other passion in her heart.</p>

<p>"Oh, Chester, please let me alone!" she cried, with
sudden petulance. "You have not known me two weeks,
and I don't want your love! I do not want anybody's
love!"</p>

<p>Suddenly she burst into hysterical tears.</p>

<p>On the night when Kathleen was so strangely rescued
from the river a man and woman left Richmond by a
midnight train for New York.</p>

<p>They were Ivan Belmont and Fedora, the woman who
had played such a cruel part in the life of Ralph
Chainey.</p>

<p>Whatever their mission in Richmond, it could not have
been an honest one, since they were leaving the city in
partial disguise&mdash;Ivan with a luxuriant blonde beard, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
his companion with a curly brown wig over her flaxen
hair, and a dotted veil drawn over her bold, handsome
face.</p>

<p>They traveled second class, and seemed to shun observation,
conversing with each other in low whispers.</p>

<p>"It was a very ugly thing for us that the old man got
away," he observed.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders, and replied:</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw! I don't think it matters. He can never
catch up with us. Who would suspect you of being the
old negro hack-driver, or me of being that old witch,
Grandmother Franklyn? Ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"True!" he replied; and echoed her laugh of security,
forgetting that "he laughs best who laughs last."</p>

<p>They thought that Uncle Ben Carew, the old, downcast
farmer, was a simple old fool; but they were doomed
to find themselves mistaken. He had his wits about him,
as he proved afterward; for as soon as he found that the
old house was deserted, he made his way from the
gloomy neighborhood into the busiest portion of the city.
Within an hour the police were notified of what had occurred,
and were organized to search for the missing girl.</p>

<p>They visited the old house, and some one who knew all
about it declared that the place had not been tenanted for
a year. The owners had died, and the property had
fallen to their daughter, who was an actress somewhere,
and had never come to claim her inheritance. The conspirators,
whoever they were, had probably taken unlawful
possession of the place just long enough to carry out
their evil purposes, and then fled from the scene.</p>

<p>The weary night passed away, but there was no sign
of the missing girl, and at the police headquarters the
old man was advised to secure the aid of a detective in the
search for Kathleen.</p>

<p>When he agreed to take their advice, and inquired who
was the best man for the purpose, they all vied with each
other in recommending handsome, dashing Jack Wren,
the finest detective in the whole South.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben, who up in Boston had pretended to be such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
a poor man, had a fat wallet in his breast pocket. He sent
for Jack Wren, and, giving him a princely retainer, placed
the case in his hands.</p>

<p>"Now, tell me everything bearing on the case," said the
detective.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben did so, and when dashing Jack heard the
story of Ivan Belmont and the diamonds, he started up
excitedly.</p>

<p>"That's your man!" he exclaimed. "Poor little Miss
Carew! things look dark for her. That miscreant has
doubtless made way with his step-sister, rather than restore
the diamonds or their value."</p>

<p>Uncle Ben fell back, white and trembling.</p>

<p>"Kathleen murdered! Oh, God! do not hint at anything
so horrible!" he gasped. "You must search for her
everywhere. It may be he has only made her a prisoner."</p>

<p>It seemed almost as if there was a fate in it that poor
Daisy Lynn, whose life-path had so strangely crossed
Kathleen's, should again become a figure on the scene of
her destiny.</p>

<p>Jack Wren having been furnished by Uncle Ben with a
photograph of Kathleen, suddenly chanced upon a face
that made him think he had found the missing girl.</p>

<p>It was a face at the window of a little cottage in the
suburbs of the city&mdash;a beautiful face, dark-eyed, golden-haired,
with piquant features, so close a copy of Kathleen's
that the detective was startled. He consulted the
photograph closely, and it seemed to him that the description
answered in every particular. So he congratulated
himself that he had been mistaken in his theory that
Kathleen was dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>"But why did they leave her alive, and what is she
doing here?" he asked himself in wonder.</p>

<p>He made some cautious inquiries among the neighbors,
and he found that the beautiful young girl was a
governess in the family of a young lawyer who occupied
the cottage. His wife was an invalid, and had employed
the young girl to fill the position of nursery governess
to her five tow-headed boys, "the worst limbs in the whole
neighborhood," averred the gossiping neighbors.</p>

<p>The new governess Daisy Lynn, as she called herself,
had only been there three weeks, they said, and they
were sure she would not stay the month out. No one
could endure that Perkins tribe more than a month. The
oldest boy was twelve, the youngest only four. "But,"
said the grocery man at the corner, "from the biggest to
the littlest, they are all imps of Satan!"</p>

<p>"But why did the girl come here? why does she stay?
Evidently she is here of her own free will," thought the
puzzled detective.</p>

<p>He made up his mind to a bold procedure: he would go
and see the girl.</p>

<p>He rang the bell at the door, and a slatternly negro
girl opened it and started at the elegant-looking caller
with his shiny hat.</p>

<p>"I want to see Miss Lynn," he said; and she showed
him into the little parlor, and went to call the governess.</p>

<p>He did not have to wait long before the face he had
seen at the window appeared within the room&mdash;such a
beautiful face, but, oh! so pale and frightened, the sweet
lips trembling as she said, nervously:</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know you, sir."</p>

<p>"But I know you, Miss Carew," he replied, as he rose
and bowed.</p>

<p>"Miss Carew!" She caught eagerly at the words.
"Oh, I knew you were mistaken! That is not my name,
sir."</p>

<p>Jack Wren laughed lightly and drew the photograph
from his pocket.</p>

<p>"Is not that your face?" he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>The lovely girl started with surprise.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! it does look like me; but I never had my
photograph taken in my life!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>The detective smiled unbelievingly.</p>

<p>"You are a very clever young girl, but I do not understand
your game," he said, bluntly. "Why have you
run away from your friends and your bright prospects,
Miss Carew, to masquerade under a false name and wear
out your life teaching the rough Perkins cubs?"</p>

<p>She trembled and grew deathly pale as she faltered:</p>

<p>"There is&mdash;there must be&mdash;some mistake. My name
is really Daisy Lynn, and I&mdash;I have not&mdash;I have no
friends and no bright prospects, except to earn my own
living by unremitting toil."</p>

<p>Tears came into the dark eyes as she spoke. The great
Southern detective looked at her with puzzled eyes.
"What superb acting!" he thought, admiringly. "But,
what the deuce is the matter with the girl, to make her
hide herself in this way from her friends?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you do not know who I am?" he said; and
he held before her eyes a card on which was neatly
engraved his name and profession.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I have heard of you, Mr. Wren!" gasped Daisy
Lynn.</p>

<p>She sunk into a chair, and put her small white hand
before her eyes, as if to shut out some dreadful sight,
her bosom heaving with frightened sobs.</p>

<p>He remained perfectly silent, and all at once Daisy
Lynn slid out of her chair and knelt in child-like humility
at his feet.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, have pity on me!" she prayed. "Go away,
and leave me in peace! I am not insane, whatever any
one may say. That was but a temporary spell, and, under
the care of the kind friend to whom Heaven directed
me that awful night, I soon recovered my reason. A
wrecked love had made me mad, but that is all over now.
Only&mdash;only you would not be able to convince them of
it. So I&mdash;I do not want to go back. Oh, God! I shall
go mad, indeed, if I am sent again to that dreadful place!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
Mr. Wren, perhaps you have a sister of your own. Think
of her, and, for sweet pity's sake, do not betray me to
my enemies, who, under the guise of friends, would
work me the bitterest woe!"</p>

<p>A light broke in upon his mind.</p>

<p>"The girl is insane. That explains everything."</p>

<p>He was a stern man, inured to trying scenes, but his
heart stirred with pity for her, so young, so beautiful,
and&mdash;insane.</p>

<p>He went up to her as she rose and sunk feebly into
her chair. Touching her kindly on the shoulder, he said:</p>

<p>"I am very, very sorry for you, but it is better that
you should return to your friends. They are almost
broken-hearted over your disappearance, and have sent
me here for you. Now, get your bonnet, like a good girl,
and come with me."</p>

<p>"I can not go back to them. I would rather die,"
sobbed Daisy Lynn; and when he insisted, she grew
frantic and rebellious. "I&mdash;will&mdash;not&mdash;go!" she cried.
"They will put me in a horrible lunatic asylum, although
I am not mad. Oh, Mr. Wren, have pity on a most unfortunate
young girl! Go away and tell them you could
not find me. Heaven will bless you for your goodness."</p>

<p>He thought it was a very good proof of her insanity
that she expected Heaven to bless him for telling a falsehood
for her sake, and smiled indulgently as he said:</p>

<p>"My dear young lady, think of the distress of your
lover if I go back without you&mdash;the rich, handsome
young man you have promised to marry."</p>

<p>An expression of blended pain and scorn crossed the
lovely face.</p>

<p>"Do not speak to me of <i>him</i>," she cried, passionately.
"It was his falsity that wrecked my life. But that brief
madness has passed. I am sane now, and I scorn him
as much as I once loved him."</p>

<p>Oh, the imperial scorn with which she drew her graceful
form erect, the fire that flashed from her lovely eyes!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
He said to himself that she was the most beautiful girl
he had ever beheld.</p>

<p>"It is not <i>he</i>, my false lover, that wants me; I am sure
of that. It is my aunt that has sent you," she continued.</p>

<p>"No, it is your uncle, Mr. Carew," he replied.</p>

<p>"But I have no uncle," she replied, in surprise.</p>

<p>He was nonplused at her persistence in deception, and
said, with rising impatience:</p>

<p>"You must really go with me and see Mr. Carew. If
there is any mistake he will detain you but a few
minutes."</p>

<p>"Will you not go and bring him here?" she asked,
beseechingly.</p>

<p>"And give you a chance to escape while I am away?
No; I am too sharp for that. Get your bonnet and come
with me to the hotel where your uncle is staying," replied
Mr. Wren, firmly.</p>

<p>With a stifled sob she rose to obey, although she said:</p>

<p>"You are very cruel, and I warn you that if I am sent
to the lunatic asylum I shall kill myself."</p>

<p>"They will not send you there," he replied, soothingly.</p>

<p>In a few minutes she joined him in the hall, heavily
veiled, and they set forth on their trip to the Broad
Street Hotel, where Uncle Ben and Teddy Darrell were
staying. He called a hack and assisted her into it, and in
a very few minutes they arrived at their destination.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben was so prostrated with grief that he had
been unable to leave his room for days. He was now in
his private parlor, and Teddy was sitting with him, both
men looking very sad and dejected, when the door suddenly
opened and Jack Wren entered, the picture of
triumph, leading a beautiful, weeping, dark-eyed girl.</p>

<p>"Kathleen, my darling!" cried Teddy, springing to
meet her; but she shrieked, in dismay:</p>

<p>"I do not know you!"</p>

<p>Teddy Darrell was about to clasp the beautiful, weeping
girl in his arms; but at her quick cry of alarm, he
recoiled in amazement&mdash;not alone at her remonstrance,
but because her voice was unlike that of Kathleen
Carew.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben, who had also started forward in eager joy,
drew back at the sound of the girl's voice, and the great
detective looked from one face to the other in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Mr. Carew," he said at last, "is this your niece?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>"No," echoed Teddy Darrell.</p>

<p>"I told you so!" cried Daisy Lynn, with a radiant
face; and Mr. Wren brought out the photograph.</p>

<p>"But this is her very face!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>They agreed with him that it was wonderful&mdash;the likeness
that existed between the girl and the picture&mdash;but
they assured him that there were subtle differences in
the features, and that the voices were quite unlike.</p>

<p>"Then I have to beg this young lady's pardon," said
the great detective, rather crestfallen at his mistake;
but he added, airily: "There's no harm done, anyhow."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, but there is," answered Daisy
Lynn, her great, eager eyes brimming over with tears.
"I have lost my situation with Mrs. Perkins through
your mistake."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" he cried.</p>

<p>"It is, alas! too true," she answered, sadly. "Mrs.
Perkins is a very high-tempered woman, and when I attempted
to explain to her why I was going out so suddenly,
she became terribly alarmed at the idea of my
being carried off by a detective. She hinted broadly that
I must have committed some dreadful crime, and discharged
me on the spot."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>"The wretch!" cried all three of the gentlemen in
chorus, and Teddy, recalling his native gallantry, hastened
to place a chair for the young girl.</p>

<p>"Pray sit down, miss," he began.</p>

<p>"Miss Daisy Lynn, permit me to present to you Mr.
Carew and Mr. Darrell," said the detective.</p>

<p>Daisy bowed as she sunk into the chair; but Teddy
Darrell stopped and stared as if he had seen a ghost.</p>

<p>"Daisy Lynn!" he echoed.</p>

<p>"Daisy Lynn!" cried Uncle Ben.</p>

<p>Both had heard the story of unfortunate Daisy Lynn,
and explanations followed all around. The tender-hearted
girl ceased weeping for herself to pity the fair
young girl who had suffered so bitterly in her stead.</p>

<p>Then Jack Wren, who, now that everything was explained,
no longer suspected Daisy of insanity, spoke his
mind.</p>

<p>"I have made a great mistake," he said. "But I know
that you will agree with me that it was very natural under
the circumstances. I beg your pardon, and am ready to
propose to you a plan by which to atone for my folly."
She looked at him attentively, and he continued: "I have
a very kind friend, a widow lady, who would be very
glad to have you for a companion, I know. If you will
permit me, I will take you to this kind lady at once, and
I am sure you will find it a more pleasant situation than
teaching those Perkins cubs."</p>

<p>"It was not very pleasant," answered the girl, sadly;
and when she saw how eager he was to atone for the
trouble he had brought upon her, she accepted his offer
with shy gratitude.</p>

<p>Taking a pleasant leave of Mr. Carew and Teddy, she
withdrew with the detective, and they were driven immediately
to&mdash;River Cottage.</p>

<p class="center">KATHLEEN AND DAISY MEET AT LAST.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No, no, 'tis vain to hover<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus round a hope that's dead;<br /></span>

</div></div>


<p>It was the day following Kathleen's petulant rejection
of her cousin's love, and the young girl, embarrassed by
Chester's grieved and dejected looks, had gone to her
room to nurse in solitude the pain at her heart.</p>

<p>"Why does no one come to me? Am I forgotten by
my uncle, Mrs. Stone, and Teddy? Their silence and
delay is very, very strange," she murmured, sadly; and
just then she heard a low murmur of voices in the parlor,
where she had left Mrs. Franklyn and Chester a while
ago, pleading a headache as an excuse for retiring to her
room.</p>

<p>"They have company. I am glad I came upstairs,"
she thought, feeling far too dejected to meet strangers.</p>

<p>The murmur of voices continued a while, then the
front door closed, and Kathleen thought the guests were
leaving.</p>

<p>Directly afterward, Mrs. Franklyn entered the room
with an excited face.</p>

<p>"Kathleen, do you remember the strange story you
told us about Daisy Lynn?" she asked. "Well, she is
here in this house! She is no more insane than you are,
and is your living image&mdash;only, perhaps, not <i>quite</i> as
pretty. She knows all you suffered in her place, and is
just dying to meet you. Will you come down?"</p>

<p>"I should like to have her come up here," answered
Kathleen, who felt as if she would like to be quite alone
at first with Daisy Lynn, the fair young girl whose line of
life had so strangely and tragically crossed her own.</p>

<p>Mrs. Franklyn understood her wish, and a few minutes
afterward she led Daisy to Kathleen's door and gently
withdrew.</p>

<p>They looked at each other&mdash;the two beautiful young
creatures&mdash;then they smiled at the likeness they saw in
each other's faces. At that smile their hearts leaped to
each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>"Daisy Lynn! Oh, you poor darling!" cried Kathleen,
holding out her arms.</p>

<p>Daisy ran into them. They kissed, then wept together.</p>

<p>They sat down side by side on the bed, like two sisters,
and wept like little children for a while; then Daisy wiped
her eyes, and said, piteously:</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Carew, can you <i>ever</i> forgive me?"</p>

<p>"It was not your fault, Daisy, darling. But you must
call me Kathleen; you know we are not strangers to each
other. I know all about you. I have lived at your home,
slept in your pretty room, and&mdash;can <i>you</i> ever forgive <i>me</i>,
dear?&mdash;I read your sweet diary! I was so lonely and so
curious over the girl whose identity had become mixed
with mine."</p>

<p>"It was very silly, was it not?&mdash;that is all I regret
about it," Daisy Lynn answered, blushing crimson. Then
she looked fearlessly into Kathleen's eyes as she added:
"But I am cured now. I despise him. I could not love
him now if he begged me on his knees!"</p>

<p>"I am glad of that, dear, for he was not worthy of
you," said Kathleen, fervently.</p>

<p>"You know him?" cried the other girl, in surprise,
and then Kathleen told her all about her wicked step-brother.</p>

<p>She was rejoiced to see how disgusted Daisy Lynn became
with the accomplished villain who had once been the
hero of her girlish dreams.</p>

<p>"But, Daisy, tell me where you have been all this
time?" said Kathleen, curiously; and Daisy smiled as she
answered:</p>

<p>"Most of the time with an old couple in the country,
to whose lonely little house I wandered that night after
I escaped from my keeper and wandered into the woods.
You see, Kathleen, I was not violently insane, only sort
of melancholy mad for a while; and because I foolishly
attempted to poison myself, an incompetent physician pronounced
me mad, and persuaded my aunt to send me to a
lunatic asylum. Well, in my horror and grief I confided
my cruel distress to those good old people, and they believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
me and pitied me. They let me stay with them,
and were as good to me as if they had been my parents.
A few months ago the good old man died, and his gentle
old wife soon followed him to the grave. Then the little
farm passed into the ownership of a distant connection
of theirs, Lawyer Perkins, of Richmond. He employed
me to teach his children."</p>

<p>She went on then and told Kathleen how strangely the
detective had found her, and all that had happened afterward.</p>

<p>"So Uncle Ben is alive, thank Heaven! I must go to
him!" cried Kathleen, springing to her feet in wild excitement.</p>

<p>"No, dear, for Mr. Wren has gone to bring them here
to you. Mrs. Franklyn told him you were here," replied
Daisy; then she started as a low rap sounded on Kathleen's
door.</p>

<p>When she opened it, there was Chester, looking so remorseful
and dejected that her tender heart leaped with
pity for his woe.</p>

<p>"May I speak to you alone for one moment, dear
cousin?" he asked, humbly.</p>

<p>She went out into the little hall with him, and Chester
manfully confessed his sin, and humbly begged her forgiveness.</p>

<p>"All my foolish plans for keeping you away from
your own true lover and winning you for myself have
come to naught. Heaven watched over you, dear Kathleen,
and foiled my selfish love. Oh, Heaven! how
ashamed I am, how wretched! and you can never forgive
me!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I can," answered the girl, nobly. She pressed
his hand gently in hers as she added: "I forgive you,
dear cousin, and I will forget all about it, and remember
nothing but that I owe you my life."</p>

<p>"God bless you!" he said, chokingly, and went down-stairs.
But he was not brave enough to meet his rival
yet. He went away for a long walk, unwilling to witness
the meeting between Kathleen and her betrothed, the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
that Jack Wren said was so rich and handsome. Poor
fellow! he might have felt happier had he known how
little Kathleen cared for Teddy. It was Ralph who filled
all her thoughts, hopeless as they were.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"How am I changed! My hopes were once like fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I loved, and I believed that life was love. . . .<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>"Love is a tyrant that has no mercy. I wish I could forget all my
past!" she sighed nightly to her pillow; but Shelley's lines would
recur to her with cruel pathos:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Forget the dead, the <i>past</i>? O yet<br /></span>
<span class="i1">There are ghosts that may take revenge for it;<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Regrets that glide through the spirit's gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And with ghastly whispers tell<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That joy, once lost, is <i>pain</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Chester had scarcely left the house before the detective
returned with Mr. Carew and Teddy Darrell. Kathleen
flew down-stairs, vouchsafed Teddy a sedate kiss,
and fell into her uncle's arms.</p>

<p>Kathleen remained a week longer with her relatives;
but such importunate letters came to her from Mrs.
Stone and Helen Fox that she decided to go home to
Boston, promising her grandmother that they should meet
often in future.</p>

<p>Leaving her friend Daisy to brighten the quietude of
River Cottage, Kathleen departed with her uncle and her
betrothed for Boston.</p>

<p>She had promised Daisy that she would stop in Philadelphia
and inquire for her about her aunt, Miss Watts.
She also wanted to see her benefactor, the kind-hearted
Mr. Hall.</p>

<p>To her dismay, she found, on inquiry, that Miss Watts
had died three months before, and her will, made years
ago, bequeathed her snug little fortune to her niece, Daisy
Lynn.</p>

<p>There were no greedy relatives to dispute the will, so
Kathleen had the blended pain and pleasure of writing
to Daisy that she was bereaved of her only living relative
by death, but that her aunt's demise had left her
rich.</p>

<p>Kathleen sent her address to Samuel Hall, and the
young man came promptly to call on her, his kind face
beaming with delight at seeing again the beautiful heroine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
of his romantic adventure. He was shocked, however,
when he heard of the second peril from which she had
escaped.</p>

<p>"It is that woman Fedora who planned it, I feel sure!"
he exclaimed; for he believed the woman was wicked
enough for anything.</p>

<p>Kathleen did not agree with him, for her uncle had
confided to her his and the detective's belief that Ivan
Belmont was the guilty party. Jack Wren had been to
Boston, carefully spotting the young man's movements
from the time that Kathleen had charged him with the
theft of her jewels, and he believed he had found a clew
that, if carefully followed up, would lead to his conviction.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben Carew was very much pleased with Kathleen's
friend, and when he left her went for a stroll down
Chestnut Street with him.</p>

<p>Sammy Hall thought that the old gentleman was very
inquisitive, he asked so many questions, getting out of
the rather quiet young man the fact that he was engaged
to a beautiful fellow-clerk, Miss Tessie Mays, but that
they thought themselves too poor to marry until he had
laid by a little sum for housekeeping.</p>

<p>"You shall hear from me again, young man," said
Uncle Ben, mysteriously; and he did.</p>

<p>Several months later, when he had almost forgotten all
about the old man's promise, he received a deed of gift
to the pretty little furnished house where Miss Watts
had lived. Uncle Ben had bought it from Daisy Lynn,
who continued to reside with the Franklyns, and he gave
it to Sammy Hall in his niece's name.</p>

<p>"Marry your lovely Tessie and be happy in your cottage
home, the gift of Kathleen's grateful heart to her
noble friend," wrote Kathleen, sweetly.</p>

<p>Sammy Hall lost no time in taking this pleasant advice,
and he and his charming Tessie spent a long and
pleasant life in the pretty cottage home. Their first
daughter was called Tessie, for her mother; but the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
time Heaven sent them girl twins, "as like as two peas,"
wrote Sammy, when he announced to Kathleen that he
had named them Kathleen and Daisy.</p>

<p>"Kathleen, you and Uncle Ben must come to me soon
for a visit. It is such a little time now before your marriage,
and I can never have you to myself again after
that!" exclaimed Helen Fox.</p>

<p>"Uncle Ben is going back to the country to-morrow,
but I shall be glad to come," Kathleen answered.</p>

<p>She had been back at Mrs. Stone's for a week, but
neither Mrs. Carew nor Alpine had called on her or sent
any message&mdash;"the heartless wretches!" as Mrs. Stone
said, indignantly.</p>

<p>Rumor said that the mother and daughter were making
hasty preparations to sail for Europe, to be absent several
years. It was rumored also that the disreputable Ivan
had crossed the sea before them, flying from justice. The
story of Kathleen's lost diamonds was public property
now; but there was no chance that she would ever recover
the jewels or their value, for Ivan had disappeared,
and his mother and sister angrily repudiated the debt.</p>

<p>Uncle Ben himself went to the two proud women, begging
them to do his niece justice.</p>

<p>"Think, madame," he said; "you and your daughter
have stripped Kathleen of everything. The jewels were
all that remained to her, and now that she is to marry a
rich man, she would like to have the money for her wedding
<i>trousseau</i>. It is very little to you out of your great
wealth, but to her it is <i>all</i>. Be just and fair, and make
good what she has lost by your son's dishonesty."</p>

<p>Mrs. Carew laughed mockingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>"I would not give her a penny if she were starving to
death!" she said.</p>

<p>"Your own husband's daughter!" he said, reproachfully.</p>

<p>"I hate her the more for that. I hate everybody he
ever loved!" she replied, vindictively.</p>

<p>"You hated poor Zaidee and caused her death, I
know," he replied, bitterly.</p>

<p>Her face suddenly grew livid, and she looked at her
accuser with startled eyes.</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it is false!" she muttered, weakly.</p>

<p>"It is God's truth," answered the old man. "You
told Zaidee Carew a trumped-up story of her husband's
falsity, and then&mdash;her death followed. Answer me this,
madame: Was her death a suicide or&mdash;a murder?"</p>

<p>She quailed before the stern old man, pale as death,
trembling with nervous alarm; but Alpine rose up suddenly
and interposed between him and her mother.</p>

<p>"How dare you distress my mother so with your shocking
hints and suspicions?" she cried, violently. "Get out
of here at once, you old wretch, or I will call Jones to
throw you out into the street!"</p>

<p>"As your mother did poor Kathleen," he sneered.</p>

<p>"And served her right," she hissed. Then she rang
the bell violently. When Jones appeared, she said:
"Take this old beggar and throw him into the street! If
you ever admit him again, you will be discharged."</p>

<p>Uncle Ben moved toward the door with Jones, but,
looking back, asked, pleadingly:</p>

<p>"Will <i>you</i> not pay your brother's debt?"</p>

<p>"Never! Now go!" she stormed, and the rich curtains
fell behind the bent retreating form; but from the
hall a strange, exultant laugh came back to them, and
Mrs. Carew shuddered.</p>

<p>"Heavens! how horribly that laugh sounded like my
husband's laugh!"</p>

<p>Helen Fox was a very bright girl. She did not tell
Kathleen that Ralph Chainey frequently visited the house,
nor did she mention to him that Kathleen was to be
her guest. Yet she knew very well that the unhappy
young lovers were sure to meet under her roof.</p>

<p>And, in fact, Kathleen had not been twenty-four hours
at Helen's when George Fox encountered Ralph somewhere,
and dragged him home with him.</p>

<p>Kathleen was playing and singing for Helen. Her
back was turned to the door, so she did not know when
the two young gentlemen entered and silently seated
themselves, obeying a gesture from Helen.</p>

<p>The young girl, unconscious of her lover's presence, sung on, sweetly
and sadly:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"One word is too often profaned,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">For me to profane it,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">The devotion to something afar<br /></span>
<span class="i3">From the sphere of our sorrow?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The plaintive words rang in sad echoes through her lover's brain:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The desire of the moth for the star,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Of the day for the morrow?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She turned around, and in a minute more she saw him
coming forward to speak to her. A start, and she recovered
herself enough to speak to him, but her voice
faltered, and the little hand, as it touched his, was
deadly cold. It was like the old, sad song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We met&mdash;'twas in a crowd,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And I thought he would shun me,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He came, I could not breathe,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">For his eyes were upon me,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He spoke&mdash;his words were cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Though his smile was unaltered&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I knew how much he felt,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">For his deep-toned voice faltered."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She did not know what he was saying to her, or what
she murmured in reply. She could realize nothing clearly
but the ecstatic consciousness of his presence, that had
such power to thrill her whole being.</p>

<p>Then she found herself slipping into a seat by Helen,
and twining her cold fingers in those of her friend. They
turned the conversation cleverly away from her, but in a
very few moments George Fox got up and left the room,
saying as he went:</p>

<p>"I will get those specimens we were talking about,
Ralph."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he called down the stairs:</p>

<p>"Helen, will you please come up and help me find
those things I brought from Palestine for Ralph?"</p>

<p>"George can never find anything without my assistance,"
laughed the young girl, as she excused herself and
left the room.</p>

<p>The unhappy lovers were alone together&mdash;perhaps by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
the clever scheming of George and Helen, perhaps by
chance; who could tell?</p>

<p>There ensued a moment of intense embarrassment.
Kathleen, sitting with down-dropped eyes, felt her lover's
eager brown eyes upon her, and a deep blush arose to her
beautiful face. Slowly she raised her bashful eyes and
they met his&mdash;deep, passionate, reproachful, beseeching,
all in one. In spite of herself, her own gaze replied to
that look&mdash;answered love for love.</p>

<p>A moment, and he rose and came toward her. She
thrilled with ecstasy as he sat down by her side. Her
little hand, icy cold a moment before, grew burning hot
as he touched it with his own.</p>

<p>"Kathleen, forgive me," he murmured, "but I can not
let this blessed chance pass. I wrote to you. Did you
receive my letter?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she faltered.</p>

<p>"Cruel girl! And you would not reply? Kathleen,
was that just or fair? Could you find no excuse in your
heart for me when I had told you my whole sad story?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;was sorry for you. I&mdash;wanted to&mdash;write&mdash;but
I promised not to," she whispered, almost inaudibly.</p>

<p>"Promised not to write to me!" His dark eyes flashed
with anger. "Who was so cruel as to forbid you? Mr.
Darrell?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;No! Teddy knows nothing. It was my uncle.
It seemed to him that it would not be right to my&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;Mr.
Darrell!"</p>

<p>"To Mr. Darrell! Oh, Kathleen, is it true, that you
will marry him? Do you love him?"</p>

<p>"Do not ask me. It is not right. You&mdash;you&mdash;are not
free!" she cried, trying to be loyal to her absent betrothed.</p>

<p>"I shall be&mdash;soon. The courts will certainly grant me
a divorce from that dreadful woman. But then, Kathleen,
my freedom will avail me nothing if you are lost to
me! Oh, my own love&mdash;my darling! be brave, and break
through the fetters that bind you to this man you do not
love! Wait for me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, the passionate pleading in his voice and eyes! how
they thrilled her soul. She wished to herself that she had
never seen poor Teddy, whom she had so rashly promised
to marry.</p>

<p>"Oh, I must not listen to you!" she sobbed. "Please,
Ralph, do not speak to me so; do not look at me! I can
not bear your eyes!" and she hid her own with a trembling
hand.</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment, but Ralph could not
give it up. It seemed to him that he was pleading for
more than life.</p>

<p>"Kathleen, don't be angry, dear; but I can not give it
up so easily," he began. "If I thought you did not love
me, if I believed you cared for Teddy Darrell, I would
not say another word. But&mdash;if&mdash;I&mdash;were&mdash;free&mdash;you&mdash;would
love me again, would you not, my dear one?"</p>

<p>Kathleen had been fighting down the weakness of her
loving heart. She looked at him with sad, hopeless eyes.</p>

<p>"Spare me!" she sighed. "Oh, Ralph, we must not
count on what has been or what may be. I am promised
to another, and I can not break my vow. Think of the
suffering I should bring to Teddy's noble heart."</p>

<p>"He would soon forget you," Ralph Chainey urged.</p>

<p>"Then you may soon forget me, too," she replied.</p>

<p>"But, Kathleen, my darling, it is so different. I love
only you, while your Teddy has had scores of loves.
Think, if you marry him, his fickle heart may soon tire
of you; then how wretched you would be!"</p>

<p>"I do not believe that Teddy is fickle. If I thought
so, I would beg him to release me from my promise.
But he loves me truly, in spite of his past, and so I must
be true to him," sadly replied Kathleen.</p>

<p>"And your marriage day is set?" he asked, gloomily.</p>

<p>"It is only two weeks from now," she replied; then
her courage failed her; she burst into tears, and sobbed
miserably against his shoulder.</p>

<p>Ralph tried to soothe her, whispering:</p>

<p>"If he knew you cared like this&mdash;for&mdash;me&mdash;he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
not want to marry you. No true lover would accept the
hand without the heart."</p>

<p>"He must never know&mdash;for&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;shall learn to love
him by and by. Mrs. Stone says so; they all say so," she
whispered.</p>

<p>"They are driving you into a&mdash;a&mdash;a wretched future
with their silly advice!" cried the young man, violently,
despair goading him to desperation. He pushed her from
him and rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"I have been deluding myself," he said, bitterly. "I
thought you loved me. I was mistaken, I see. I will
never humble myself to you again, proud Kathleen.
From this moment to my life's end, we are strangers.
Farewell!" and with a stately bow he was gone.</p>

<p>Kathleen sprung to her feet with wild despair at her
loss.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ralph! come back!" she cried, faintly; but he
was beyond the reach of her voice.</p>

<p>She threw herself weeping into the chair where he had
sat but just now.</p>

<p>"Gone&mdash;and forever!" she sobbed in bitterest agony,
and there came over her a longing to die and be at rest
from her sorrow. Life seemed too bitter to be borne, now
that the last hope had failed, and Ralph had gone from
her "forever."</p>

</div></div>


<p>Ralph Chainey left the presence of his loved and lost
Kathleen with a heart full of bitterness and pain, and
hurried home.</p>

<p>He had concluded his engagement in Boston the previous
evening, and it was a great relief to him, for he
was eager to get away from the city that held Kathleen.
Stay there, and see her wedded to another, he could not!
That way lay madness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>He had dismissed his company for several months. He
was going to travel, he said, although the manager pointed
out to him that now was the time to reap a golden harvest,
if ever. He was even more popular now than before, if
such a thing could be. The divorce proceedings had
given him notoriety. People who had not gone to see
him act before, went now, just for a sight of his handsome
face.</p>

<p>He loved his art, but the money was no object to him.
Fortune had already showered her golden favors on him
in lavish measure. He could not be tempted to remain.</p>

<p>"No, mother, I can not stay," he answered, sadly,
when she pleaded with him. "I must get away as soon
as this divorce business is settled. That will be soon&mdash;in
a week or so, my lawyers tell me. Then I will go
abroad and try to live down this unpleasant notoriety.
You do not blame me, mother?"</p>

<p>She sighed, but answered bravely:</p>

<p>"No; but it will be very lonely, my son."</p>

<p>"You will have my brother, his wife and little ones to
cheer you," he said, moved to the heart by her tears. He
knew well that he was her favorite son.</p>

<p>He kissed her, and went to his own room, wrote some
letters, and then went with his mother for a drive. At
night he felt as if the day had been a month long. Oh,
how cruel it was, this love that mastered him in spite of
his pride!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"You may rouse your pride, you may use your reason,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And seem for a space to slay Love so;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But all in his own good time and season<br /></span>
<span class="i3">It will rise and follow where'er you go."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He threw himself down, dressed, on a couch in the
luxurious room, and gave himself up to bitter-sweet memories
of the girl he loved so hopelessly, living over in his
thoughts every time he had met her until now, when her
dark eyes had made shipwreck of his life. Time passed
unnoted, although the tiny French clock had tinkled
musically the midnight hour.</p>

<p>What a picture of manly beauty he made, lying there
with half-shut eyes on the rich couch with its Oriental
draperies. The gas-light, half-turned down, cast weird
shadows all about the room. In the little sleeping-room
beyond, seen through the half-drawn <i>portière</i>, all was dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
and still. Did a white, desperate face with gleaming eyes
peer out of that gloom upon the young man resting there
in his velvet dressing-gown, one shapely hand tossed up
over his brown curly head, the dark, curly lashes drooping
downward to the pale cheek?</p>

<p>Yes, he was well worth looking at, this gifted young
actor, this genius who at barely twenty-five had scored
such dazzling successes in the dramatic world, and written
his name up high upon the scroll of fame. It was no
wonder that women raved over his beauty and his genius,
and that they filled his daily mail with love letters that
he flung into the fire after one contemptuous glance.</p>

<p>But were they eyes of love that gleamed on him now,
lying so pale and still and sad, with his thoughts upon his
beautiful young love?</p>

<p>Alas! a gleam of tigerish hate shone in those steel-blue
orbs as they watched the young man; and when at
last the fringed lashes drooped against his cheek, a faint
sigh of relief escaped the lips of the impatient watcher.
For hours and hours she had been waiting there; but it
seemed as if he did not mean to retire to-night. Now he
had fallen into a light doze. Perhaps he would sleep
there all night.</p>

<p>Oh, Ralph Chainey, wake! From the curtained darkness
beyond a fiend is gliding toward you!</p>

<p>The shrouding hood of the long cloak has fallen back
from the face of a woman&mdash;a bold, handsome face with
steel-blue eyes, and glittering golden hair. In her upraised
hand glitters a long thin dagger, on her face is
stamped in awful, ashen pallor the fell purpose&mdash;murder!</p>

<p>But he sleeps on lightly, dreaming, perhaps, of Kathleen,
while this beautiful fury glides soundlessly across
the thick moquette carpet, gains his side, poises her shining
weapon on high, aims for his heart, and&mdash;it descends,
it pierces his breast!</p>

<p>Ralph Chainey was sleeping but lightly, and as the cold
steel entered his breast a shudder ran over his whole
frame, the dew of pain started on his brow, and with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
shriek of mortal agony he staggered to his feet, clutching
blindly at the midnight assailant.</p>

<p>She had not counted on this; she thought her frenzied
blow would be short, sharp, and decisive, that she would
have time to fly from the scene of her terrible crime.</p>

<p>She was mistaken. His outstretched arms caught and
held her with the momentary fierce strength of a dying
man; his blood spurted out in hot streams upon her face
and hands.</p>

<p>And meanwhile his shriek of agony had aroused the
house. Earl Chainey, his brother, started wildly from
his dreams, and his wife, affrighted at that awful sound,
buried her pale face in the pillows. Mrs. Chainey, lying
awake and restless, brooding over her son's departure,
recognized Ralph's voice in an instant, and, with a terrible
foreboding of evil, sprung forward to his rescue.</p>

<p>Upon the threshold of the door they met&mdash;the mother
and her elder son. Earl flung the door wide, and together
they sprung into the room.</p>

<p>Not a moment too soon was their entrance, for Ralph's
momentary strength had failed from the profuse loss of
blood. He had struggled madly to hold his assailant, but
her superior strength had overpowered him, and as he
sunk back heavily upon the couch, she raised her bloody
weapon for a second, surer blow.</p>

<p>But it never reached its mark, for Earl's strong arm
caught and flung her fiercely aside as he knelt by his
fallen brother.</p>

<p class="center">"MY LOVE SHALL CALL HIM BACK FROM THE GRAVE!"</p>


<p>"Oh, my dear, how ill you look this morning. Surely
you did not sleep well!" Helen Fox exclaimed, gazing
in surprise and pain at Kathleen's pale cheeks and heavy,
somber eyes.</p>

<p>It was the morning after her painful interview with
Ralph. Kathleen had not closed her heavy eyes all night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
for thinking of her lost lover and his cruel, parting
words. They had pierced her heart like a thorn, and
some sweet, sad lines, strangely appropriate, rang in dizzy changes
through her brain:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It came with the merry May, love,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">It bloomed with the summer prime;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In a dying year's decay, love,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">It brightened the fading time.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I thought it would last for years, love,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">But it went with the winter snow&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Only a year ago, love&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Only a year ago!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Twas a plant with a deeper root, love,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Than the blighting Eastern tree;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For it grew in my heart, and its fruit, love,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Was a bitter morsel to me.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The poison is yet in my brain, love,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The thorn in my heart, for you know,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">'Twas only a year ago, love&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Only a year ago!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Yes," the girl thought, sadly, bitterly, "the root of
that love went so deep in my heart that I can never pluck
it out unless my life goes with it! Oh, God! that I <i>could</i>
forget&mdash;that I could give <i>all</i> my heart to the one who
holds the promise of my hand! Oh, Teddy, Teddy!
you deserve more of me than this! You are so good, so
noble, you believe in me so fully, little dreaming that the
heart which should be yours is given to another!"</p>

<p>She looked at Helen with a smile so faint that it was
sadder than tears. She could not speak, and Helen put
her arm tenderly about the drooping little figure, so pathetic
in its unspoken despair, understanding without one
word all the sorrow in Kathleen's heart.</p>

<p>And even then the newsboys running through the
streets were shouting wildly:</p>

<p>"Extra copies of <i>The Globe</i>&mdash;all about the murder of
the handsome actor, Ralph Chainey, by his jealous wife!"</p>

<p>Their startled ears caught the sound&mdash;the name.
Starting apart, the two beautiful young girls gazed with
blanched faces into each other's eyes.</p>

<p>The words were repeated clearly just beneath the
window&mdash;blasting words, that coldly drove the shuddering
blood back from Kathleen's lips to her heart. With
a moan, she slipped down to the floor, winding her arms
about Helen's knees, leaning her head against her while
she wailed:</p>

<p>"Dead! Murdered! Oh, my love, Ralph!"</p>

<p>Then consciousness fled, she slipped inertly to the floor,
and Helen, with a pallid face and trembling limbs, ran
out to purchase a copy of <i>The Globe</i>.</p>

<p>Ere Kathleen had recovered from her swoon, Helen
had hastily run over the startling news&mdash;the attempted
murder of Ralph Chainey by Fedora, the woman whom
he was suing in the courts for divorce.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"But for the opportune entrance of his brother, Mr.
Earl Chainey," ran the paragraph, "the fiend would have
succeeded in her fell design. The deadly blade was descending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
a second time to sheath itself in the victim's
breast, when she was caught and violently hurled aside
by Earl Chainey. She proved to be Fedora, the wife
whom he was suing for divorce. She now lies in a
prison cell, awaiting her punishment, which will probably
be a capital one, as Ralph Chainey has never regained
consciousness, owing to the loss of blood, and his
death is momentarily expected."</p></blockquote>

<p>It was to bear this terrible shock to her heart that
Kathleen recovered consciousness. Was it not a wonder
she did not go mad with the horror of it all?</p>

<p>Parting from her only yesterday in despair and anger&mdash;lying
dead, perhaps, this moment&mdash;dying at least, and
dying before he had forgiven her for her coldness and
hardness. Oh, God, the pity of it all!</p>

<p>Weeping, she lay upon Helen's breast. Pride all gone,
she laid her heart bare to her sympathetic friend.</p>

<p>"Oh, Helen, it will kill me unless I go to him&mdash;unless
he speaks my forgiveness before he dies!"</p>

<p>"You <i>shall</i> go my darling," was the answer; and in
less than an hour the carriage was at the door. The two
girls stepped into it, and they were rapidly driven to Mrs.
Chainey's suburban home.</p>

<p>All the way Kathleen lay upon her friend's breast,
weeping, always weeping. In all her long after-life she
could never forget that long hour of misery and suspense,
in which she could not tell whether she should find him
dead or alive. Would he pronounce her forgiveness, or
would his lips be stiff in death, and the memory of his
anger remain forever a thorn in her heart?</p>

<p>How the cold March rain swirled through the leafless
shrubbery about the great stone house, with its closed
doors and windows, suggesting so vividly the presence
of death. Thank God! there was one thing lacking&mdash;the
funereal crape upon the door. At the worst, he was
still alive.</p>

<p>"Alive, alive! oh, thank God!" murmured Kathleen
through her raining tears.</p>

<p>Helen tenderly supported her as they left the carriage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
Soon they were within the house; Kathleen was waiting
with a wildly beating heart for some one to come to
them.</p>

<p>But when Ralph's mother came to them, Kathleen was
beyond speech. It was Helen who had to prefer the request
that they should see Ralph&mdash;"Friends, old and dear
friends," she said, in excuse.</p>

<p>The gentle, gray-haired lady looked in wonder at the
beautiful, weeping girl, the fairest she had ever beheld.
Her heart went out to her at those tears.</p>

<p>"They are for my boy," she thought, tenderly.</p>

<p>But she hesitated, for the doctors had forbidden any
one to enter the room.</p>

<p>"He knows no one. He has spoken but twice, and
then just to utter a name," she said, looking doubtfully
at the two fair supplicants.</p>

<p>"A name?" whispered Kathleen, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes; it is that of a young girl whom I fancy he
loves. If it were only <i>her</i> now," she said, musingly.</p>

<p>"The name?" questioned Helen Fox, with eager impatience.</p>

<p>"Kathleen!" replied Mrs. Chainey.</p>

<p>Oh, what a cry came from Kathleen's lips!</p>

<p>"Oh, my love, my love, you have not forgotten me! I
am Kathleen! Oh, madame, let me go to him!"</p>

<p>"Come!" was the thrilling answer, and as she led the
girl away, Kathleen's heart throbbed wildly with the
thought that she should hear his lips pronounce her forgiveness.</p>

<p>"And he shall not die! My love shall call him back
from the grave!" she sobbed.</p>

<p>She was kneeling by his couch&mdash;she was gazing through
her blinding tears upon that pallid, emotionless face, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
still now as though it already bore the stamp of death;
her hand touched his, but it did not respond to her passionate
pressure, and when she called his name, there was
no answer&mdash;not even a quiver of the dark, curling lashes
lying so heavily against the marble-white cheek.</p>

<p>Mrs. Chainey and the two physicians looked on in the
tenderest compassion. The story of the young girl's
love was written on her anguished face, and they knew,
alas! that Ralph Chainey lay close to the borders of
spirit-land. The dark eyes would never open on that
most beautiful face bending over him, the pale lips would
never unclose to speak her name.</p>

<p>Breathlessly she called upon his name, beseeching him
to look at her, to speak to her; but the spell that wrapped
him was too deep. Those strong men listening to her
wept in sympathy. They had no hope. It had been so
difficult to stanch the flow of blood from the terrible
wound so close to his heart, that he was sinking from
inanition&mdash;he could not survive the weakness.</p>

<p>Suddenly the girl turned and looked at them. They
were whispering together. She caught some disjointed
words:</p>

<p>"It has been tried with success. You remember cases
of?&mdash;but he is so far gone, I doubt&mdash;transfusion of blood&mdash;do
you think?"</p>

<p>It startled them, the way the weeping girl sprung to
her feet. New life seemed to come to her. She threw off
the long fur cloak from her slender form, pushed back
the sleeve from the most beautiful white arm they had
ever beheld, and cried, beseechingly:</p>

<p>"You can save him! Oh, take my blood&mdash;my very
life, so that you restore him!"</p>

<p>They were shocked at first, but she would not listen.
She implored them to yield to her wish.</p>

<p>"I am so strong, I have such splendid health, it will not
hurt me&mdash;I can bear it!" she cried, pleadingly, and they
were full of admiration for her courage and bravery.</p>

<p>Her lovely face shone with its lofty purpose.</p>

<p>"Impossible!" they answered; but they gazed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
admiring eyes at the beautiful girl whose fresh young
loveliness indeed hinted at glowing health and strength;
but it seemed hopeless, such an experiment. He was so
far gone. Any minute might launch his life's bark out
upon death's unknown sea.</p>

<p>She could not bear it, this obstinate refusal. Oh, to
save him, to save him she would lay down her life!</p>

<p>A desperate thought came to her. Her dark eyes fastened
on a rich blue vein in the rosy white arm she had
bared to their view. A furtive movement and she had
slipped from the burnished mass of her golden tresses
a toy dagger with a jewel-studded hilt. Maddened with
misery, she thrust the keen point against the blue vein, and
the scarlet tide of her life-blood spurted out in a tiny vivid
jet. Oh, horror!</p>

<p>They sprung toward her, one bound a handkerchief
over the wound, but&mdash;her bravery had thrilled their
hearts. They could not hesitate longer. It was a forlorn
hope, but yes, they would try the experiment!</p>

<p>Doctor Beard was an enthusiast in his art, and his fine
eyes shone with eager interest as he realized the delicate
and dangerous operation that lay before him and his colleague,
Doctor Miller. Both were comparatively young,
but they had attained eminence already, and if any physician
in Boston was capable of conducting this experiment,
it was one or both of these two.</p>

<p>They gazed anxiously into each other's eyes as they
made their hasty preparations. Would it fail, or would
it succeed? Death was so near&mdash;so perilously near!
Would the rushing tide of life ever flow through those
numb veins again? Yes, if there were any efficacy in
love and prayer; for the stricken mother knelt, weeping
and praying, by her boy's side, and down-stairs, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
darkened parlor, Helen Fox, waiting in keen suspense,
lifted her heart in earnest petitions that God would spare
the young life trembling in the balance. Within the great
house all was trembling anxiety and suspense, while outside
the wild March wind shook the dead branches of the
trees and drove the gusty rain against the windows with
a mournful patter, as though kindly Nature wept for the
bright young life going out into darkness.</p>

<p>When years had fled and gray hairs began to creep into
their bonny brown curls, Doctor Beard and Doctor
Miller still loved to tell the story of that day, and how
it ended&mdash;of the patient who lay so close, so awfully
close to the portals of death that it did not seem possible
for human art to save him, and of the beautiful, brave
young girl who had prayed them on her knees to take the
blood from her round, white arm and infuse it into the
patient's, giving him new life; how they had hesitated to
wound that tender, exquisite flesh, and how she had taken
the initiative, thrusting a jeweled pin from her hair into
the blue vein.</p>

<p>"I tell you it was <i>grand</i>!" cried Doctor Beard, with
enthusiasm. "I could hesitate no longer. I was longing
to make the experiment from the first moment the
thought entered my head. So we asked the consent of
Miss Fox, the young girl's dearest friend, who had
brought her there. She was willing, and we tried it.
Tried it, and&mdash;with the grandest success."</p>

<p>"It was magical the way that the girl's fresh young
blood put new life into him," agreed Doctor Miller.
"Why, I give you my word, I had <i>no</i> faith in the operation.
The fellow looked like a dead man. I could have
sworn he would never revive again, yet&mdash;it was magical,
as I said just now&mdash;when we had carefully bound up
their arms, that brave, beautiful girl leaned over him,
looked into his face, and cried in accents of piercing anguish:</p>

<p>"'Oh, Ralph, my darling, come back to Kathleen!
You must not die!'"</p>

<p>"And you may believe me or not," said Doctor Beard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
taking the thread of the story again, "but the dead man
opened his eyes and met her look. The color began to
come back to his ashen face. He smiled faintly, whispered
her name, 'Kathleen,' turned on his side, and slept
calmly as a weary child."</p>

<p>"That was the proudest moment of my life!" cried
Doctor Miller. "God bless brave, bonny Kathleen
Carew!"</p>

whom she had risked so much, yet who seemed to have
left her to her fate without an effort to save her.</p>

<p>"Where is he? What has become of him? Will he
leave me to die like a rat in a hole? And I thought he
loved me&mdash;fool that I was! Did I not already know men
too well to trust him? Oh, fool that I was! And yet,
dare he desert me, the partner in his terrible secret? Perhaps
the coward has fled, fearing that I may betray him!"</p>

<p>So she raved on, every moment increasing her impotent
fury.</p>

<p>"No answer to my letters, no notice taken of my passionate
appeals! Why, he might have effected my escape
ere this if he had tried, and I <i>must</i> escape! It is
true I can not be hung, since that foolish girl saved
Ralph's life when he was on the brink of death; but if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
I am sentenced I shall be sent to prison for long, long
years! I can not bear the thought! Oh, God, I'm stifling&mdash;dying!"
She threw herself on her hard couch, sobbing
in hysterical <i>abandon</i>.</p>

<p>A grating sound at the door; the key turned in the lock;
the portal opened, closed again. Inside stood a beautiful
young girl gazing with sad, accusing eyes at the wretched,
sobbing woman.</p>

<p>Fedora looked up with a cry of wonder mingled with
rage:</p>

<p>"Kathleen Carew!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Kathleen!" answered the other. She advanced,
and they gazed in momentary silence into each other's
eyes&mdash;the girl Ralph Chainey loved, and the woman that
was his wife.</p>

<p>"Why are you here?" muttered Fedora, hoarsely, as
she started to her feet.</p>

<p>"For justice," answered Kathleen, sternly.</p>

<p>"Justice?"</p>

<p>"Yes, justice to the man you tried to murder&mdash;the
man I saved from death!"</p>

<p>"Saved, yes&mdash;curse you forever for that deed!"
snarled the prisoner, viciously.</p>

<p>Kathleen recoiled a little at her terrible aspect, and
said, in wonder:</p>

<p>"Why did you do it? Why did you want him dead?"</p>

<p>"I hated him! I hate you!"</p>

<p>"I know, but you would soon have been free of him
by the law. Why did you want to kill him? It was horrible.
Life is so sweet when one is young; and Ralph
is young&mdash;only twenty-five," said the young girl, almost
piteously.</p>

<p>"Why do you come here to probe into my secrets?"
Fedora cried, fiercely. "Listen, then: I wanted him
dead before he secured the divorce, so that I might inherit
his wealth. I, his loving widow! Ha! ha! Was
it not a clever scheme?" She laughed wildly; and, coming
closer to Kathleen, glared threateningly into her eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
as she hissed: "You foiled me&mdash;you&mdash;curse you, I repeat!
Let me but escape, and I will murder you!"</p>

<p>A weaker heart than Kathleen's might have quailed
before such threats; but she stood there trembling but
courageous, an earnest purpose in her splendid eyes.</p>

<p>"These are idle words, and I did not come here to
bandy words with you. I came to make a solemn appeal
to you," she said meekly, almost beseechingly.</p>

<p>"Appeal to me?" asked the prisoner, with a scornful
laugh; and then she waited out of curiosity for the other's
answer.</p>

<p>"Do you remember that night in Philadelphia?" Kathleen
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember."</p>

<p>"You were wearing my diamonds&mdash;the ones that were
stolen from me that night when I was left for dead on
the ground at Lincoln Station. You told me&mdash;told me,"
her voice faltering, "that Ralph Chainey gave you the
jewels. Oh, God! I think if I had quite believed that
horrible story, I should have died! But there was always
the merciful doubt&mdash;the hope that it might not be true&mdash;that
saved me from madness!"</p>

<p>She paused, but the prisoner did not speak&mdash;only
smiled derisively.</p>

<p>"So I have come to you for the truth," went on the
girl. "Oh, for God's sake, speak and tell me you lied!
It was not Ralph; it could not be. Perhaps you are
shielding the guilty man behind his identity. Are you?
Tell me the truth! I will not ask you to betray the criminal.
I do not wish to punish him. Only tell me it was
not Ralph!" and she waited in wild suspense for the
answer.</p>

<p>Fedora's evilly handsome face had on it a smile of triumph.
She was gloating over the young girl's misery.</p>

<p>"So you love <i>my husband</i>?" she exclaimed, tauntingly,
and the deep color rose up over Kathleen's face at the
cruel sneer. She trembled with emotion, although she
tried to appear indifferent as she answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>"I did not come here to discuss <i>that</i> with you,
madame."</p>

<p>Fedora was regarding her with a fixed gaze. A cunning
thought had entered her mind.</p>

<p>"How much is my secret worth to you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"All the wealth in the world, if I had it, but I am penniless.
I can not buy your secret," Kathleen answered,
sadly.</p>

<p>Fedora came nearer and whispered in her ear:</p>

<p>"If I tell you the truth, will you help me to escape?"</p>

<p>"I could not do it if I wished to do so ever so much.
It would take money, and I have already told you I have
none."</p>

<p>The voice was cold and dull. Kathleen began to realize
how hopeless was her mission. The cruel, calculating
woman before her had no pity for her misery.</p>

<p>But Fedora was scheming in her mind how to turn
her secret to account. She hated Kathleen too bitterly
to show her any kindness; but if she could pay for the
secret she wanted so badly, why, let her have it.</p>

<p>She looked at Kathleen with a cunning expression.</p>

<p>"There is one condition on which I will tell you what
you want to know."</p>

<p>"I have already told you that I have no money."</p>

<p>"I do not mean money. Listen, Miss Carew: You
know Ivan Belmont?"</p>

<p>"Yes," with a contemptuous gesture.</p>

<p>"He is a friend of mine; and if he knew about my
trouble he would try to help me, I think. Do you know
where he is? Can you send word to him?"</p>

<p>"I do not know anything about his whereabouts."</p>

<p>"You must find out. You must tell him that I, Fedora,
have sent you to him. Tell him I command him to come
to me here. Return to me with a letter from Ivan Belmont,
and you shall hear the truth about the diamonds.
I swear it!"</p>

<p>They gazed at each other&mdash;Fedora flushed and eager,
Kathleen excited, sorely tempted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>"What say you? Is my price too great?" demanded
the prisoner.</p>

<p>"No," Kathleen replied. Turning to go, she said:</p>

<p>"I will surely find Ivan Belmont, and bring the letter."</p>

<p>The door closed. The prisoner was again alone within
the grated cell.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<p>The hours dragged on and brought the gloomy night.
With it there hovered over the great city the black and
vulture wings of a terrible storm. It hissed, it roared, it
swept with devastating, cyclonic force through that area
where the prison was situated. Trees, roofs, houses even,
yielded to its terrific fury, and flew like feathers before
its angry breath. The poor prisoners, cowering in superstitious
terror before the awful voices of the warring
elements, prayed to God for mercy; but the answer
seemed far, far away, for suddenly there came a terrible,
deafening roar; the earth seemed to rock like a cradle,
and the great stone tower of the prison fell with a sound
as though heaven and hell had clashed, while lurid flames
shot up from the awful ruin into the midnight air. Sentence
of death had already been pronounced on many who
were awaiting trial, and many a soul went up in that holocaust
of smoke and flame and tempest to render an account
of the deeds done in the flesh. Some few survived,
some few escaped. Where was Fedora?</p>

<p>"Another letter! Gad, they come thick and fast! Ta,
ta, Fedora! sorry I haven't time to read it; but a fellow
must look out for his own neck, and mine has felt deuced
uncomfortable ever since I found out that that devil Jack
Wren is on my trail. How <i>did</i> he strike it, I wonder;
for I thought we had covered up our tracks very cleverly.
But the fellow's a sleuth-hound, they tell me, and I've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
got to escape him. Poor Fedora! it's a pity to leave you
to your fate, but the sooner I pack up and be afloat on the
briny, the better for my neck," muttered Ivan Belmont,
airily, as he moved about his shabby apartment, in a very
unsavory quarter of Boston, gathering together his belongings,
that were scattered about on chairs and tables.</p>

<p>The letter from Fedora that he had found on coming
in he tossed unread into the fire, and as he ransacked the
bureau drawers he hummed, carelessly:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Long have I been true to you,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Now I'm true no longer.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was long past midnight. The tempest had spent its
force, and only a fitful, soughing wind and gusty dashes
of icy rain remained as souvenirs of its terrific fury. Its
worst force had not reached this neighborhood, and Ivan
little dreamed that the prison doors had been hurled
asunder by the blind force of nature, and that his partner
in wickedness had been released and was hastening to
their rendezvous in eager joy.</p>

<p>Recklessly he flung on the floor her dainty garments
and pretty trinkets, seeking the diamonds he had given
her in the days when he loved her first&mdash;love that had long
ago tired, and had now grown heedless, indifferent.</p>

<p>"But what the devil did she do with them? I'm positive
she left them here. Can they have been stolen?
They are worth a pretty penny to me now&mdash;they would
help me to get away from this place that is getting too
hot to hold me."</p>

<p>"Help you to get away, you coward! Who helped
me, I wonder? The devil, I suppose. They say he takes
care of his own!" said a mocking voice behind him. He
turned with a start. There stood Fedora!</p>

<p>Fedora or her ghost? The voice was there, the glittering,
steel-blue eyes; but where was all the prettiness,
where the burnished golden locks, the silk attire? This
woman was drenched with rain, clothed in rags, and the
disheveled tresses that straggled over her brow and shoulders
had turned dead white, and their silver gleam was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
awful contrast with the drops of blood that trickled down
her ashen face.</p>

<p>He stared like one turned to stone. He doubted the
evidence of his own eyes. That voice, those eyes&mdash;but
could it be Fedora?</p>

<p>"Yes, it is I," she said, answering that mute, wondering
look. "I am here, escaped from the wreck of my
prison to find you&mdash;you dastardly thief&mdash;trying to steal
my jewels, your own gift to me! You shall suffer for
this night's work! Villain! you tempted me to aid you in
your crimes, then left me to suffer the penalty alone.
But I will betray you, and you shall know how it feels to
be shut within prison walls, deserted by the one who
swore fealty forever in happier days!"</p>

<p>He had been so disgusted, so enraged, that he was
about to retort in angry, sneering words that would drive
her forever from him; but at her threatening words his
defiant mood changed to one of cringing, abject fear.
Though inwardly shrinking from her altered looks in
keen disgust, he dared not show his feelings. He must
temporize; he must turn her from her savage purpose.</p>

<p>He approached her; he held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Ta, ta, Dolly; we are not going to part in this fashion,
are we? Surely you did not mind if I sold the diamonds
to get you out of prison. It was a big bribe, I
know; but the guard would not listen to a penny less.
To-morrow you should have been free; but how lucky
that you escaped, and we have the jewels still!" He
slipped his arm around her, and&mdash;in spite of her anger, in
spite of her suspicions of his falsity&mdash;the woman's head
dropped against his breast.</p>

<p>She loved him with all the heart she had, this petted
darling of the foot-lights; she who had trifled with the
hearts of nobler men had found in this weak nature her
ideal, and he led her on to lower and lower depths until
she was wrecked on the shoals of sin.</p>

<p>Nestling in the arms that were so reluctant to hold
her, Fedora told the man how she had escaped from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
prison in the company of an aged prisoner&mdash;a convict under
a life-sentence for murder.</p>

<p>"You have often told me that your father was dead,
Ivan," she said. "Did you believe it, or was it a falsehood?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;believed it," he replied, weakly.</p>

<p>"No, you did not," she replied, triumphantly. "Ah,
my lord, how proud you have been of your connection
with the Carews! Yet your father is an escaped convict
under sentence for life! Have you forgotten his name?
Let me refresh your memory. George Harrison&mdash;alias
Dutch Fred. Ah, you start&mdash;you remember! Yes, he
told me his whole history, and I gave him the address
of your mother&mdash;once his wife. He will go to her, he said,
and demand half her fortune!"</p>

<p>Ivan Belmont was silent a moment from chagrin. Then
he rose superior to the situation.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! how the <i>mater</i> will rave!" he laughed. "I
wish papa success in plucking the madame. The devil
knows what a time I had coaxing and wheedling pennies
out of her pocket."</p>

<p>The vision rising in his mind of this proud mother and
sister's consternation roused his risibilities, and he
laughed loud and long. They had discarded him&mdash;flung
him off like a dog. What a glorious retribution!</p>

<p>But they turned presently from even this savory morsel
to their own affairs. Both were in peril, and it would not
do to remain in reach of the law. Yet Ivan was by no
means ready to give up his cherished plans. They sat far
into the wintry dawn, exchanging confidences and plotting
new schemes, to be unraveled on Fate's dark loom.</p>

<p>"Jones says there is a horrible old man down-stairs,
mamma, asking for you, and will not go away until he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
sees you," Alpine Belmont said, entering her mother's
<i>boudoir</i> one rainy evening just a few days after the
cyclone.</p>

<p>"I will not see him. I have just refused to see that
old impostor&mdash;my husband's brother, indeed!" contemptuously&mdash;"and
I will not be annoyed again. Tell Jones
to send the old beggar away."</p>

<p>Alpine was pale. Her eyes had a troubled look.</p>

<p>"He says that he is not a beggar, mamma&mdash;that he
has claims on you. I am afraid you had better see him.
He is making such a noise at the door, and Jones says
he is somewhat intoxicated."</p>

<p>"Tell Jones to pitch him into the street."</p>

<p>"He tried to, but the old man was more than a match
for him. Do come, mamma; it's so disgraceful, the sensation
he is creating. People are gathering around the
house. Let us have him in and try to pacify him."</p>

<p>Her arguments conquered, and Mrs. Carew sent down
word to admit the old man to a small room where the
servants were accustomed to come to her for orders.</p>

<p>Alpine's trepidation had somewhat unnerved her
mother, and as she swept into the little room her air was
a trifle less haughty, and her proud eyes gazed anxiously
about for the cause of this commotion.</p>

<p>There he lay, sprawled upon a luxurious sofa&mdash;an old,
blear-eyed man in ragged garments, but with a very close-shaven
head, and the stubble of several days' growth upon
his chin. His keen, close-set eyes devoured with a hungry
gaze the handsome face before him.</p>

<p>A cry of surprise and terror burst from her blanching
lips:</p>

<p>"George!&mdash;George Harrison!&mdash;<i>you</i>!"</p>

<p>"Yes, George Harrison&mdash;your husband!" answered
the intruder, and a hoarse cry of despair broke upon the
air from the lips of Alpine, who had glided in unheeded
by both.</p>

<p>She stood behind her mother, gazing with affrighted
eyes at the man's coarse, leering face.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carew recoiled&mdash;she threw out her white hands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
all glittering with costly rings, as though to shut out some
terrible sight.</p>

<p>The man laughed at her terror and, gliding forward,
seized and held her hands.</p>

<p>"Are you glad to see me, my wife? Come, give me a
kiss for the old times' sake, my beauty!"</p>

<p>She struggled with him, loathing the offered caresses,
and Alpine sprung to her mother's assistance, beating him
back with dainty jeweled hands.</p>

<p>He turned then and saw her for the first time. His
narrow eyes dilated with surprise.</p>

<p>"Why, you pretty wild-cat, you must be my daughter
Alpine! How do you do, my dear? Give your papa a
kiss, dear!"</p>

<p>"You are not&mdash;not&mdash;&mdash;" she choked over the word, and
he answered, with sudden gravity:</p>

<p>"I am your father, George Harrison, my little girl,
and I went to prison for life for killing a man who was
once my dearest friend. Why? Well, your mother
might tell you if she would. I will spare her for your
sake. You seem to love her." He seemed to have grown
suddenly sober after the first sight of his daughter's face.
"Well, she has prospered, has she not? She is rich and
grand, while I have lain in prison all these years, but a
few miles from her, my heart burning with hate for her,
and aching with love for my boy and girl, Ivan and Alpine,
while she taught them to forget that they ever had
a father other than Vincent Carew, the proud millionaire.
Alpine, speak to me for once; call me father!"</p>

<p>A spasm of pain contracted the worn features he raised
longingly to her face. Love shone in his eyes, poor convict
that he was, and although he had come to curse the
mother and extort money from her, the memory of it
fled from him now as he gazed imploringly on Alpine's
lovely, soulless face. With outstretched hands he besought
her kindness.</p>

<p>Surely the fiends in hell could have had no more hateful
look than the girl turned upon the suppliant as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
bowed the knee before her so entreatingly. Angrily she
struck at the outstretched, toil-worn hands, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"You have no claim on me. I hate you&mdash;hate you!"</p>

<p>Could a strong man's heart break for so common a
thing as a child's hardness and ingratitude? It would
seem so, for the escaped felon turned aside with such a
look on his face as it might have worn had a dagger
pierced his heart. It seemed as if he meant to go. He
staggered toward the door, tripped, and fell prostrate.
His face quivered with one or two spasms, then he lay
still and dead, his white face upturned to their startled
gaze.</p>

<p>"Dead!" muttered Mrs. Carew, staring down in mingled
terror and relief.</p>

<p>"Dead!" echoed Alpine, in a sort of awe.</p>

<p>And for a few minutes there was a terrible silence.</p>

<p>Then Alpine crept to her mother's side.</p>

<p>"Mamma, was it true?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it was true. There, you have my awful secret.
Bury it deep in your heart, Alpine, for no one must ever
know. Now we must call the servants to put the body
out. We can not have anything so vulgar as a dead tramp
lying in the house!"</p>

<p>She moved toward the door, but her steps were arrested
by a stern voice:</p>

<p>"Stay!"</p>

<p>She turned with a start and shudder.</p>

<p>A man had emerged from behind the curtain. At
first sight it seemed to be Uncle Ben Carew, the old man
so cordially despised.</p>

<p>But with a rapid hand he flung off wig, whiskers, and
spectacles, standing revealed in majestic beauty&mdash;Vincent
Carew!</p>

<p>"My God!" she cried, and flew to embrace him.</p>

<p>He repulsed her with scorn and loathing.</p>

<p>"How dare you, you Jezebel?" he cried. "Down on
your knees to that dead man there, you and your cowardly
daughter, and pray his forgiveness for the sin
that wrecked his life! Vile creature that you are, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
would throw him into the street like a dog! No; let him
lie there to be buried at my expense. I heard all that
was said. I know all your guilty secrets!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Vincent, forgive me, forgive me! My temptation
was so great!" she cried, frantically; but he spurned
her outstretched hands.</p>

<p>"Can one forgive a fiend?" he said, sternly. "I tell
you I know all&mdash;the plot that broke my Zaidee's heart,
and drove her to madness and death&mdash;perhaps you murdered
her&mdash;who knows?"</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;I swear I did not! I am innocent of that
charge. She was so young, so jealous, it was easy to
drive her mad. But, Vincent, it was for love of you!
Can you not forgive so great a love?"</p>

<p>If scorn could have blasted her, his look would have
struck her dead at his feet.</p>

<p>"Forgiveness is not possible," he answered, bleakly,
and silenced her with a gesture of his hand. "Listen,"
he said, looking her in the face: "I was not lost at sea
when my ship burned. I was cast away on a desert
island, where I remained until a few months ago. When
I returned I took a fancy to masquerade to see how matters
were going. There is no Uncle Ben. I never had
a brother, but the disguise has served its purpose. I know
you now&mdash;you and your scheming daughter. Now listen
to your fate. No, do not speak. Hear me out. I will
keep the secret of your disgrace; and&mdash;you were to have
sailed to-morrow&mdash;you two&mdash;for Europe. Your trunks
are packed&mdash;your passage taken. You will go, just the
same, but you will never return. You have no claim on
me. You belong to that dead man there. Go now to
your rooms. I wish never to look on your faces again,
but the curse of a broken-hearted man will follow you
to your grave!"</p>

<p class="center">"I WILL GO TO THE OLD HAUNTED MILL," SAID KATHLEEN,
BRAVELY.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We must love and unlove and forget, dear,<br /></span>

</div></div>


<p>Kathleen Carew sat in the library of Helen Fox's
home, with her cheek bowed in the hollow of her delicate
hand, and a very sad expression in her downcast
eyes. She was thinking of the tragedy of two weeks ago,
by which the prison walls had been rent asunder, sending
so many wicked souls to their account with God.</p>

<p>"And in that awful wreck Fedora perished&mdash;poor
guilty soul!&mdash;and with her died the secret I would have
risked so much to know. Now I shall never know it;
but Ralph, dear Ralph, I must trust you blindly. I must
not let this dark cloud of suspicion drift between us.
But, oh, Heaven! that it might have been lifted!" she
half sobbed, in her self-absorption.</p>

<p>In those two weeks many things had transpired of interest
to Kathleen. The Carews had gone abroad, and,
although Kathleen knew it not, they had faded forever
out of the life that they had done so much to wreck and
ruin. Uncle Ben, as he still called himself, had not yet
disclosed his identity to his daughter, but kept up his
<i>incognito</i> for reasons best known to himself. The grand
Carew mansion remained closed and silent, and people
said that Mrs. Carew and Miss Belmont intended to be
absent for years.</p>

<p>Ralph Chainey, under the magical influence of renewed
hope, was fast recovering his health again. Kathleen and
Helen had been to see him several times, and, although no
tender words had been uttered between them, Ralph no
longer feared and dreaded handsome Teddy. He fancied
that all would come right between him and his darling.</p>

<p>But Kathleen was very sad at heart. She had the
greatest esteem and regard for her betrothed, and shrunk
from telling him the unflattering truth that her heart belonged
to another man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>"He has been so good and kind to me, how can I grieve
him so?" she thought.</p>

<p>The ring of the door-bell startled her from her sad
thoughts.</p>

<p>Several letters were handed in. On one she recognized
the writing of her cousin Chester. She broke the seal
with eager impatience, and as she read on smiles began
to dimple her scarlet lips.</p>

<p>Helen, who was reading her own letters, was startled
at a gay exclamation from her friend.</p>

<p>"Oh, Helen! good news! Chester and Daisy are&mdash;engaged!"</p>

<p>"But I thought it was you he loved, my dear."</p>

<p>"Oh, a mere fancy! It is that dear, darling Daisy
Lynn he loves. And she&mdash;there's a little note from her,
too&mdash;she has forgotten or outlived that old love&mdash;gives
her whole tender heart to Chester. Listen, Helen, how
he writes me&mdash;apologetically, you know, fearing I may
think him fickle."</p>

<p>She read aloud, with a mischievous smile playing round
her lips:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Both born of beauty at one birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">She held o'er hearts a kindred sway,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Helen smiled in sympathy.</p>

<p>"Poor boy! I'm glad he's to be made happy," she said.
Then she nervously fingered a letter she held.</p>

<p>"<i>Mine</i> is from Loyal," she said, bashfully.</p>

<p>"From Loyal? Oh, Helen, is he ever coming back
to America? You cruel girl! why did you send him
away?"</p>

<p>"I did not know my own mind," the beautiful young
girl answered, in a low voice, and then she added, softly: "You remember those sweet lines
of Jean Ingelow?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Thou didst set thy foot on the ship, and sail<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To the ice-fields and the snow;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thou wert sad, for thy love did not avail,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And the end I could not know.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How could I tell I should love thee to-day<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Whom that day I held not dear?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How could I know I should love thee away,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">When I did not love thee anear?'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Oh, you darling, I'm so glad!" cried Kathleen,
springing to her friend's side and giving her a girlish
hug. "That dear Loyal Graham! I always thought he
was perfectly grand, and I know you will be happy with
him. Does he <i>know</i> yet, darling?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and he is coming home to <i>me</i>;" and her soft
blue eyes drooped with a loving smile to the dear letter.</p>

<p>Ah, the gladness, ah, the madness, ah, the magic of a
letter!</p>

<p>And Helen recalled the beautiful lines of Adelaide Proctor:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>"I must go and tell mamma that I shall marry Loyal,
after all," said the blushing Helen, gliding from the
room; and then Kathleen turned to her other letter.</p>

<p>It was superscribed in a strange hand&mdash;feminine, yet
bold and dashing.</p>

<p>"It is a strange hand," Kathleen said to herself, as she
tore it open; but stranger yet were the words it contained&mdash;strange,
few, mysterious:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If you wish to have full proof of the guilt or innocence
of the man you love, come alone at twilight this
evening to the old Cooper saw-mill, where I am dying. I
can not survive the night. Do not hesitate about coming.
I know that a beautiful young girl like you will do and
dare all for love and happiness, and it is all-important
that you should know what I have to tell you. If I die
with the secret untold, you will forever rue it. Come
without fail, secretly and <i>alone</i>. Destroy this letter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="smcap sig">"One Who Knows All."</p>

<p>Kathleen read and reread this strange letter with fascinated
eyes.</p>

<p>"I know the old Cooper saw-mill," she murmured.
"It is on the old country road where we used to drive
so often, near the glen and the waterfall. I have seen
old Myron Cooper, too, that strange old man with his
long gray duster. People said he wrote poetry as wild
and gloomy as the glen where he lived. Yes, I will go,
although they say the old mill is haunted after nightfall.
But my unknown correspondent is right. A young girl
will do and dare much for love&mdash;love, that mighty passion
that moves the whole world."</p>

<p>She spent the remainder of the day in restless thought,
longing for the hour to come when she should go upon
her strange mission, and yet half ashamed of the longing
to know all the truth about her lover.</p>

<p>"Why is it that I can not trust him wholly?" she asked
herself; but the reckless curiosity of a woman's nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
drove her forward on that perilous quest fraught with
mystery and danger. "I must <i>know</i>!" she declared,
passionately, to herself.</p>

<p class="center">TEDDY'S LOVE LETTERS.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Closely shut within my chamber,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Where the fire is burning bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">All these letters, long since written,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">I must read and burn to-night."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>"I wonder what has detained Jack Wren? He promised
to be here this evening at five o'clock sharp. Here
it is six," Teddy Darrell said, impatiently, as he looked at
his watch, then lingered dreamily a moment over the fair
face of Kathleen smiling up at him from within the golden
lid.</p>

<p>"Sweet darling! in a few more days she will be mine,"
he murmured, and forgot Jack Wren in sweet anticipations
of his wedding-day now near at hand.</p>

<p>Teddy was waiting in his rooms for the detective;
and now, to beguile the time, he took some letters from
his inside pocket and began to run over their perfumed
contents, smiling softly now and then to himself.</p>

<p>Then he got up, walked about the room, shook himself
together and sighed, then laughed.</p>

<p>"Poor little dears! it's hard to give you up, after all."</p>

<p>The "little dears" probably referred to Teddy's old
sweethearts, whose names were "legion"&mdash;such a string
of them there was: Hatties, Helens, Lauras, Gussies,
Saras, Emmies, Roses, Fredas, Annies, Nellies, Katies,
Lenas, Noras, Mauds, Nannies, and so on through a list
of the belles and beauties of several seasons, whose letters
and photographs were treasured in Teddy's desk, soon to
be ruefully sacrificed to the fire-fiend; for "Benedict, the
married man," must not carry any of these sentimental
mementoes of the past into his new life.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here a dainty school-girl's letter<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Still retains its faint perfume,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But the little hand that wrote it<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Molders in a foreign tomb.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Close beside it lies another<br /></span>
<span class="i3">In an awkward, girlish hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Desperately sentimental&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Ah! I now can understand<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Just how silly two such lovers<br /></span>
<span class="i3">As we were then must have been&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She about a year my junior,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">I a youngster just nineteen!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Teddy unlocked a drawer of his desk and brought out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
a miscellaneous pile of letters, photographs, faded flowers,
and locks of hair of every shade known to woman's
head. I am ashamed to record it of Kathleen's prospective
bridegroom that he cast glances of unfeigned regret
at these treasures as he prepared to devote them to
the flames&mdash;a sacrifice on the altar of his love for Kathleen.</p>

<p>How he lingered over those pretty photographs!&mdash;over
Rose, the beautiful actress, in the dress she had worn
as Iza in "The Clemenceau Case."</p>

<p>"Ah, Rose was a model girl!" he laughed, as he laid
it down and turned to stately Laura in the two-thousand-dollar
gown, the very envy of all her feminine friends
when she wore it to Madame Frivolity's ball. Next to
it was Gussie, with her sweet and serious face, the dark
curls lying softly against her temples, the dimpled white
shoulders peeping above the little sleeves of that simple
white lace dress in which Teddy had liked her best. He
gazed long and earnestly at the girlish face, and a memory
came to him of that moonlight evening in the vine-covered
arbor when Gussie's arms had clung about his
neck, drawing his dark, handsome face down close to
hers while the blue-gray eyes gazed tenderly into his
dark ones as she whispered, in answer to his question,
"My dear old Dark Eyes, I love <i>you</i>!"</p>

<p>"Upon my soul, I believe that flirtation hit me hard!
She was the sweetest of them all, and I was almost sorry
I let her marry Bob. Ah, well, Gussie, dear, I too shall
be married soon, and these bitter-sweet memories of
ours must be tossed into the rag-bag of the past!"</p>

<p>He sorted out <i>her</i> letters, and placed them with her picture
in a secret drawer, for he had a lingering fondness
for his old sweetheart, pretty Gussie, the famous novelist.</p>

<p>"I will just keep these," he said. "I don't believe
Kathleen would care, for she reads and loves Gussie's
novels. And if anything should happen that I do not
marry Kathleen&mdash;and it was strange the way she acted
about Chainey&mdash;I should like to know I have these still."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>He gathered all his mementoes and, with a genuine sigh,
flung them upon the glowing blaze.</p>

<p>"It is but just to Kathleen," he said, trying to stifle
his regret.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Back the mists of years are rolling<br /></span>
<span class="i3">As these relics of the past,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With a wondrous fascination,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Have their spells around me cast.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Crowds of tender recollections<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Fill my eyes with unshed tears;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Dimmer grows the glowing future&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Dimmer till it disappears."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Teddy had a warm heart, and it was no disloyalty to
Kathleen that made him sigh so sadly. He would not
have exchanged her for any other girl he had ever loved;
but somehow the thought of Gussie haunted him. She
had been his first love, and it was a lover's quarrel that
had driven them asunder. That was several years ago,
and now she was married and a shining literary light: but
it was quite certain that if ever Kathleen had a rival in
Teddy's thoughts, it would be this one lost love.</p>

<p>A loud rap at the door startled him. It was Jack Wren,
who entered in haste with an excited face.</p>

<p>"I had quite given you up, Mr. Wren," said Teddy,
startled out of his tender recollections.</p>

<p>"Darrell, come with me. We have no time to lose. I
have made a startling discovery. I have a cab waiting
below, and you must come with me to the rescue of one
you love, for she is at this moment in peril of her life! I
have been on Ivan Belmont's track ever since I saw you,
and he and Fedora, who escaped from the prison when
the cyclone shattered it, are together now at Cooper's
saw-mill, in Wild Cat Glen, plotting a terrible crime!"
breathlessly answered Jack Wren.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXVIII" id="CHAPTER_LXVIII">CHAPTER LXVIII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">IN MORTAL PERIL.</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Listen to the water-wheel<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All the live long day&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How the clinking of the mill<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wears the hours away.<br /></span>
<span class="i26">&mdash;<i>Old Song</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>People always wondered why old Cooper ever built his
saw-mill in so wild a place as that lonely glen; but the
scene, the crazy old building, and the strange old man, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
seemed to chime together, and no one was surprised that
when he died he expressed the wish to be buried in the
glen, close to the old mill, that his dreamless rest might
be soothed by the sound of the grinding wheel day by day.
Madame Rumor said that the old man's ghost haunted
the wild, forbidding gorge, and Kathleen shuddered with
dread as she climbed up the rocky path, with the cascade
tumbling wildly beneath, on her rendezvous with her unknown
correspondent. She had come within half a mile
in a cab, which she left waiting for her while she made
the rest of the journey on foot. To escape Helen's kind
inquiries, she had said she was going to spend the night
with Mrs. Stone, which she really intended doing on her
return.</p>

<p>How gloomy the old mill looked in the pallor of the
swiftly falling night! All winter the snows had held it
bound in an icy thrall, but now the April sun had sent the
mass of foaming, dashing water tumbling over the falls,
and turned the old saw. What a scene for a crime!
thought Kathleen, with a thrill of superstitious dread,
as she hurried on in the deepening gloom, casting furtive
glances about her, as though she expected to see Cooper's
disembodied spirit hovering near. Frightened and nervous,
she half regretted that she had come, and at the
hooting of an owl in the tree near by, she uttered a frightened
scream which rang through the gloomy glen in hollow,
reverberating echoes, and fell prostrate on the
ground.</p>

<p>An icy fear seemed to clutch her heart. It seemed to
her that she had no strength to rise to go on. The gloom,
the darkness, coupled with the mystery of the whole
affair, began to weigh with crushing force upon her
spirits.</p>

<p>She laid her fair golden head down on the rough stones,
and prayed piteously:</p>

<p>"Dear God! give me strength to go on, to bear whatever
is before me! For, oh! I love him so, I love him so!
and I <i>must</i> know if he is worthy of that love! If he is
not&mdash;if they tell me he is guilty of that sin with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
Fedora accused him, dear God, let me die! I can not live
and know him false and wicked! I would sooner throw
myself over those rocks down into the terrible cascade,
and end my wretched young life!"</p>

<p>New courage came with that incoherent prayer, and
struggling to her feet, she tottered on, murmuring faintly:</p>

<p>"Oh, Ralph, dear Ralph, how much I must love you
to risk so much for your sake!"</p>

<p>She gained the threshold at last. With a hopeful glance
upward at the feeble glimmering light in the window,
she knocked upon the door. It was jerked rudely open
on the instant, and Kathleen saw before her a frowsy-looking
old woman with a short clay pipe in her mouth.</p>

<p>This repulsive old woman thrust out a hand and
dragged the trembling girl into the mill.</p>

<p>"What made you so long? I've been expecting you
more than an hour!" she exclaimed, in a tone of savage
anger.</p>

<p>Not waiting for an answer, she dragged the girl rudely
along with her into a small room, and, turning quickly,
slipped the bolt into the lock.</p>

<p>Kathleen gave a startled glance around the room. No
one was there but the old hag, who was gazing at her with
malicious eyes, in whose tigerish gleam of hate there was
something so strangely familiar that she shuddered with
terror, and a name leaped to her lips:</p>

<p>"Fedora!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Fedora; but you have keen eyes to see through
this disguise," cried the woman. "Do you remember, I
told you I would murder you if I ever got out of prison?
Well, I shall keep my vow!" She sprung savagely toward
her, but at the cruel grasp of her foe Kathleen uttered
a moan of horror and slipped limply to the floor like
one already dead.</p>

<p>"Is she dead so easily? I hope not, for I want to torture
her first!" hissed Fedora, spurning the prostrate
body with her foot.</p>

<p>She tore open the door at a slight tap upon it, and stood
face to face with Ivan Belmont.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>He spoke hurriedly:</p>

<p>"Ralph Chainey is coming, Fedora! Quick! lock the
girl in, and come out and meet him alone. I must not be
seen yet."</p>

<p>Fedora obeyed him, and Kathleen, coming back to life
with a shuddering gasp, found herself alone, locked in,
and heard outside the voice of her lover, and the words
spoken held her spell-bound.</p>

<p>"Kathleen? Where is Kathleen? She told me to meet
her here."</p>

<p>With a hissing laugh of savage hate, Fedora flung off
the hood that she wore and stood revealed, scarred, hideous,
gray-haired, but Fedora still&mdash;the woman who held
his honor in her light keeping and bore his name.</p>

<p>"Kathleen is dead!" she laughed. "Dead, and I killed
her without a blow! My weapon was a lie. It slew her
as fatally as a dagger!"</p>

<p>He could not speak. He could only stare at her in
dumb horror as she continued:</p>

<p>"Do you see these diamonds flashing in my ears?
They are the ones that were stolen from Kathleen Carew
the night of the attempted murder, when you found and
saved her at Lincoln Station. I told her that you, my
husband, did that foul deed, and robbing her of her
money and jewels, brought them to me. A fiendish lie,
you say? Ha! ha! but it killed her, all the same. Do
you want to know the real thief? It was Ivan Belmont,
my lover; and she was slain by a lie!"</p>

<p>Kathleen had struggled with difficulty to her feet. She
tottered to the little window that looked into the mill;
she saw her noble lover's handsome face, and uttered a
piercing cry:</p>

<p>"Ralph! Ralph! I am here! Save me! Save me!"</p>

<p>He sprung toward the voice. The movement was fatal.</p>

<p>Ivan Belmont had stolen up softly behind him, bearing
a heavy mallet in his hand. A moment more, and it was
lifted high in air, and Kathleen's anguished eyes beheld
her darling struck down before her into apparent death!</p>

<p>Kathleen would never forget the horror of that moment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
It seemed to her that she went mad with grief
and terror. Shriek after shriek burst from her lips, and
she beat her little hands wildly against the smoky little
window-pane, struggling wildly to get free. But the fiends
before her did not heed her cries. Between them they
lifted the inanimate form of their victim, and bearing it
a short distance away, but in full view of the window,
they laid it on a plank upon a table in front of the large
steel circular saw. Kathleen saw his arms fall limply to
his side, and the dark curly head drop back heavily. The
death-white face, the closed eyes, assured her that he was
either in a deep swoon or already dead from the terrible
blow that had felled him to the ground.</p>

<p>Hushing the piercing shrieks upon her blanched lips,
Kathleen watched in terrible suspense the movements of
the two fiends.</p>

<p>Perhaps they doubted whether their victim was already
dead, for they bent over him, feeling his pulse and listening
for his heart.</p>

<p>"He lives," Ivan Belmont said, with fiendish joy. "Let
us bind him hand and foot, and leave him on the plank
till he revives. I want to enjoy his agony when he
realizes the awful death that lies before him. He must
know that Kathleen is here, that she will witness his death,
and then meet the same horrible fate."</p>

<p>It was a scene on which the devils in hell might have
gloated: the old mill, with its dim lights and strange,
flickering shadows; the prostrate man, with his death-white
face; the two fiends binding him with strong cords,
lest he should recover and escape their vengeful fury;
and looking on with anguished eyes at the doom of her beloved
was our beautiful Kathleen.</p>

<p>"He revives!" hissed Fedora.</p>

<p>"Good!" laughed Ivan, hoarsely; and he looked back
over his shoulder at Kathleen's convulsed, almost supernaturally
pale face at the window.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! my proud lady, you would send me to prison
for stealing your diamonds, would you? But I foiled
your game! It was I that decoyed you to Richmond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
with a lying letter; I that flung you into the deep, dark
river to perish. Well, you escaped then, but you will
not be so fortunate now. Do you realize the fate that
lies before you? I decoyed both you and your lover here.
Why, you ask? For revenge upon you both. Do you see
yonder glittering saw, with its hungry teeth, waiting to
cut your delicate body to atoms and drink your life-blood?
Well, we are only waiting for you to see your
lover dead before we devote you to the same torture. He
is dead already, you say? No; he is reviving. See that
tremor creep along his frame! See his eyelids tremble!
Ha! his eyes open! he sees! he understands! Oh, the
anguish on his face! How happy it makes me! Look,
Fedora, at his tortures. Are we not already avenged?"</p>

<p>Her answer was a laugh of fiendish triumph.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; it is glorious&mdash;glorious! I am in no haste
for their death. I like to see them suffering like this.
I want to prolong their torture!" she exclaimed. "What
do you say, dear Ivan? Shall we let them live a few
hours yet to realize the horrors that surround them?
What avails their love, their beauty, their wealth now?
To-morrow they will be lifeless clods, and I the rich
widow, Mrs. Chainey!"</p>

<p>"Baffled!" said a hoarse, triumphant voice, and, turning,
she met Ralph Chainey's burning gaze. "You mistake,"
said her victim, faintly but audibly. "I made my
will weeks ago, and divided my whole fortune between
my mother and Kathleen."</p>

<p>A scream of baffled fury escaped her lips; but Ivan
said, quickly:</p>

<p>"You can contest the will, Fedora."</p>

<p>"Yes; I will fight for my rights to the bitter end!" she
shrieked, then sprung toward him in a fury. "Let us end
this farce; let us show them no further mercy. He dies
now, Ivan! Go, set the saw in motion!"</p>

<p>He moved forward in eager obedience to her order, and
Ralph Chainey realized that his moments were indeed
numbered, and that death in the most horrible and soul-sickening
shape was approaching. He made an almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
superhuman effort to burst the bonds that held him fast,
but the attempt was useless. He was weakened by the
illness through which he had just passed, and could not
move. With a prayer in his heart to Heaven, he turned
his dark, despairing eyes toward the beautiful, anguished
face at the window.</p>

<p>"Courage, my own love!" he called to her, bravely.
"Death is but a fleeting pang, and then it will be life forever.
Turn your sweet eyes away, my own Kathleen; do
not torture yourself with the sight of my fate. You will
come to me soon, and we&mdash;&mdash;" His voice broke, drowned
by the whir of the wheel as it began its revolutions,
slowly drawing the plank with its doomed victim within
its jaws.</p>

<p>Oh, God, what a moment!</p>

<p>Surely the pitying angels, who know and see all things,
hovered near and aided weak, despairing Kathleen in her
frantic struggle for liberty.</p>

<p>As Ivan Belmont stepped out to open the water-chute,
she sprung with a strength born of despair against the
door. The rusty lock yielded to her onslaught, the door
fell crashing beneath her weight, and staggering, tottering,
her loosened golden hair flying like a banner behind
her, Kathleen fled across the moonlit space, the torturing
sound of the revolving wheel grating on her ears, the
flying sawdust blinding her eyes, and gained his side.
Brave Kathleen, noble Kathleen, you are not one-half a
second too soon! The swift revolutions of the saw are
drawing your doomed lover closer to the encroaching
steel! Throw out in an agony those fair white arms,
gifted with such momentary, wondrous strength, grasp
your loved one wildly, eagerly, and draw him madly from
his couch of deadly peril! Saved! And watching angels
weep joyful tears at the victory of love over hate and
revenge.</p>

<p>Fedora, dazed with wonder, mad with rage, darted forward
to thwart Kathleen's angelic purpose. But Heaven
had interposed. Ere she reached them, Kathleen's frenzied
hands had dragged Ralph from the fatal plank. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
falling body struck the fiend, tripping and throwing her
violently upon the cruel saw. Blindly she threw up her
arms, shrieked in demoniac fear, and then&mdash;there came
a horrible, grating sound, the sickening smell of fresh
blood spurting into the air, and&mdash;Fedora's headless body
fell with an awful thud upon the floor, while from the
gloom beyond there followed upon her dying shriek the
sound of pistol-shots and men's angry voices! Jack
Wren and Teddy Darrell had arrived upon the scene;
but only that the heavenly hosts had helped Kathleen,
they would have come too late.</p>

<p>Ivan Belmont, in the midst of his exultation over his
terrible crime, had met a swift retribution. Turning to
rejoin Fedora, and gloat with her over the destruction of
their victims, he was confronted by the detective and
Teddy Darrell. Snatching a pistol from his breast, he
fired at the foremost one, and received in return a fatal
bullet from the ready weapon of the dashing detective.
He fell dead, and his crime-stained soul wandered forth
on the wings of the night, with that of Fedora, to the
realms of darkness and eternal gloom.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hastening into the mill in search of Kathleen, the two
men were horrified to find upon the floor the ghastly, decapitated
body of Fedora.</p>

<p>In another moment they saw near at hand the inanimate
forms of Ralph and Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Oh, Heaven, we are too late! They are all dead!"
exclaimed Teddy in anguish; but a low moan from Kathleen
arrested him.</p>

<p>He stooped over his beautiful betrothed and lifted her
in his arms. She opened her eyes, but they gazed blankly
into his, and Kathleen murmured, gladly:</p>

<p>"Ralph, darling! I have saved you from a terrible
death. Thank God! thank God! for I love only you, and
had you died, I should have gone mad with grief!"</p>

<p>Teddy Darrell started and shivered, but the arms that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
held Kathleen did not let her fall, only pressed her closer
to his throbbing heart.</p>

<p>"She loves Ralph Chainey. That is the key to the
mystery of her coldness for me," he murmured, sadly.
"Oh, my beautiful love! must I then lose you? I loved
you so, and I would have tried to make you so happy.
Must I give you up?" And only the pitying angels knew
the pang that rent his heart.</p>

<span class="i0">I know you love me, Kathleen, dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Your heart was ever fond and true,<br /></span>

</div></div>


<p>But true love is never selfish. Teddy Darrell's heart
bore that cruel wrench gravely and in silence. They took
Ralph and Kathleen home; and a few days later, when
the girl was stronger and better, her noble young betrothed
came to her and bravely gave her back her promise.</p>

<p>"I know all your love for Ralph," he said. "I know
how bravely you have held to your promise to me. I
have not one unkind thought of you, dear, and I give you
back your vow, for I know you would be happier with
him than me. But think sometimes of me, Kathleen, for
I shall always love you."</p>

<p>He meant what he said, and he thought it would be so,
but something happened just a few weeks later that
changed all the world to handsome Teddy Darrell.</p>

<p>Far away, in a beautiful Southern home, where the
magnolias bloomed and the orange groves drooped their
white blossoms down on her dark head, a beautiful young
widow laid aside her pen too often to dream of one who
had been her lover in the dear old days, before that fatal
quarrel had driven her into a marriage for pique with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
proud, rich man who had now been lying for more than a
year beneath a costly granite shaft in Howard Cemetery.</p>

<p>To-day, in a magazine that she had been reading, some
sweet, sad lines had touched her heart. Obeying an uncontrollable
impulse, she drew pen and ink toward her,
exclaiming:</p>

<p>"What if I copy these sweet, sad verses and send them
to my dear old Dark Eyes? He is not married yet, I
know, and I will send him the notice of Bob's death with
the verses; for I love Ted still, and I would give the
world to win him back!"</p>

<p>And so the letter came to Teddy from that far-off
Southern home, and he read with tender eyes the little
poem, entitled "Dark Eyes," which it contained:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Which eyes do I love the best,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Dark or blue or gray?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each are beautiful and blest<br /></span>
<span class="i3">In their way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I think if some sweet soul<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Dearer to us than the rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone through light or dark, we'd love<br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>That</i> color best.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One I loved in happier days,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Under happier skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One whose looks breathed only praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Had <i>dark</i> eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Darkly radiant eyes that rest<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Nevermore to wake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I love <i>dark</i> eyes the best<br /></span>
<span class="i3">For <i>his</i> sake.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dark eyes, oh, you haunt me yet<br /></span>
<span class="i3">With your magic splendor!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All my heart holds one regret<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Deep and tender.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft you come as all sweet things,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Memory-saddened, come;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the scent of roses brings<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Dead perfume.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As the sadly dying strain<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Of a song we used to know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stirs the heart to sudden pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">You come and go;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shining on me in my dreams<br /></span>
<span class="i3">With the light you used to wear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deepening with your starlight beams<br /></span>
<span class="i3">My despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the sad heart in my breast<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Throbbing seems to break,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I love dark eyes the best<br /></span>
<span class="i3"><i>For his sake</i>!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Teddy's dark eyes grew dim, but he smiled as he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Bob had blue eyes, so she must mean <i>me</i>, for she used
to call me her 'Dark Eyes.' Poor fellow! I'm sorry he
died; but I do believe all the old love for Gussie is coming
back again. I'll take the first 'flier' for the South."
And, sure enough, it was only a few months later that he
bore away from the Crescent City the fairest flower of
the Magnolia State, his bonny bride.</p>

<p>But it was long before Teddy's wedding-day that he
had cards to attend a grand reception at the Carew mansion
on Commonwealth Avenue.</p>

<p>It seemed that Mrs. Carew really meant to stay abroad
for years, for Madame Rumor said, in a week after their
departure, that the handsome old house had been rented
to a rich and eccentric old man, a relative of the late
Vincent Carew. Kathleen herself was surprised when
she received that letter from Uncle Ben, far away in his
country home, telling her all about it.</p>

<p>"I wanted to give you a big party on your betrothal to
that grand young actor, Ralph Chainey, my dear, so I
rented the house from the agent, and I want you to be
sure to come, Kathleen," he wrote. "Never mind about
buying a new dress, dear. Uncle Ben is not as poor as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
looks, and you must come in your every-day dress. Go
up to your own old room, and you will find there a new
dress and jewels, a gift from Uncle Ben."</p>

<p>To know that Uncle Ben was rich was surprise enough,
but when Helen and Kathleen arrived with Mrs. Fox and
Mrs. Stone at the mansion, she was transported with joy
to meet in the hall her aunt, Mrs. Franklyn, her cousin
Chester, and beautiful, happy Daisy Lynn.</p>

<p>"Uncle Ben invited us on a long visit," they exclaimed,
and hurried her upstairs to the beautiful rooms once her
own, but to which, for almost two years, Kathleen had
been a stranger.</p>

<p>Kathleen, now the happy promised bride of noble Ralph
Chainey, could not keep back the tender tears as she
crossed the threshold of the familiar rooms; but Daisy
wiped them away, begging her to look at her new dress.</p>

<p>"The people will be coming presently, and you don't
want Mr. Chainey to see you with pink rims around your
beautiful dark eyes," she said, gayly, and hurried her into
the beautiful white dress costly enough for a bride.</p>

<p>"And here are these diamonds, Kathleen, that he gave
you to replace those that you lost by the villainy of Ivan
Belmont," continued Daisy, lifting a set of glorious diamonds
from their white velvet bed.</p>

<p>They slipped through her white fingers like rivers of
light, and Kathleen uttered a cry of rapture.</p>

<p>"They are worth a fortune! Oh, how good Uncle
Ben is to me! I must put them on and go down to him,
Daisy."</p>

<p>But when she was going along the hall in the beautiful,
bride-like robes, she paused suddenly at the library door.</p>

<p>"Daisy, I must go in alone to see papa's portrait first,"
she said, and tears came into the lovely eyes as she crossed
the threshold.</p>

<p>Again she knelt before the portrait, weeping for the
loved and lost, but suddenly Uncle Ben came in and stood
by her side.</p>

<p>"He wronged you, my darling, and left you to fight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
the bitter battle of poverty alone. How can you forgive
him?"</p>

<p>She put her hand in his, and answered, sweetly:</p>

<p>"My step-mother was to blame, I'm sure, Uncle Ben,
and so I have never harbored one unkind thought of my
dear, dead father; and, oh, what would I not give if he
were alive to-night to bless Ralph and me in our happiness!"</p>

<p>"My angel daughter!" cried the old man, and he flung
aside the disfiguring disguises in which he had masqueraded
while unmasking his wicked wife. There he stood,
tall, dark and handsome, although with a sadness that
would never leave his face&mdash;Vincent Carew, her beloved
father!</p>

<p>She flew to his arms, and they had a blessed half hour
of sacred rejoicing and love. Then there came a light rap
on the door.</p>

<p>It was Ralph Chainey, handsome as a prince in his
evening suit.</p>

<p>"They told me to come here for you, my darling! Oh,
how beautiful you are!" he cried, taking her into his
arms.</p>

<p>Vincent Carew came forward into the light.</p>

<p>"See, papa has come back to me," she said; and he
smiled on the pair of lovers. He had had a rooted antipathy
to actors, but for Kathleen's sake he was willing to
accept Ralph Chainey for a beloved son-in-law. Kathleen
had whispered to him that she was to marry her lover
soon, and he shook hands most cordially now with the
young man ere he turned away and left them together for
a few sweet moments before they joined the guests.</p>

<p>Ralph took beautiful Kathleen in his fond arms, and
kissed that radiant face with adoring love.</p>

<p>"My love, my bride so soon to be," he whispered; and
then she drew him away.</p>

<p>"We must go, although I had rather stay here with
you, dear love," she whispered; and they went along the
hall arm in arm, happiest lovers the world ever knew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>Daisy Lynn was singing at the piano when they entered
the crowded drawing-room. It was a song that Vincent
Carew had chosen. The words rang out in sweet and
jubilant echoes on the air:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I'll take you home again, Kathleen,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Across the ocean wild and wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To where your heart has ever been<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Since first you were my bonny bride.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To that dear home beyond the sea<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My Kathleen shall again return;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when thy old friends welcome thee<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy loving heart will cease to yearn!"<br /></span>
